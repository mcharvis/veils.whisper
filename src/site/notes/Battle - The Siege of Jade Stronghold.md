### **The Beginning**

The Sanctifiers came in force—thirty-eight of them—led by Bladedancers at the front, Bulwarks forming the iron spine, Dominators singing their dreadful litanies, Hollowborn crawling through the walls, Penitents dragging their chains, and Veilshifters flickering between the mortal and the unholy.

The gates of Jade Stronghold boomed under their charge. Commander Velexia drew her jade-edged blade, her voice rising above the thunder:

“Hold. For the Stronghold. For Oasis.”

### **Phase I: The Breaking Wave**

The Sanctifiers surged.

- **Veilshifters** blinked into the courtyards, pulling guards screaming into the shadows. Poliren, Wes, and Piran vanished before their blades even swung.
    
- **Bladedancers** vaulted the barricades, cutting down Drovin and Jon in a blur of steel.
    
- **Bulwarks** smashed through the first gate, shields splintering the wooden doors. Gravik and Rex braced against them, holding the line long enough for Ellis, the Quiet Child, to shriek a ghostly wail. One Sanctifier dropped dead, his soul ripped screaming into the Veil.

Borin Scaletooth’s bandits swarmed from the side, gutting a Penitent, while Roghera the Wight tore open a Bladedancer’s chest.

But the cost was high: all mastiffs were slain in the opening crush, and Sir Darethin fell to a Dominator’s spear.

### **Phase II: Fire in the Courtyard**

The Sanctifiers poured into the lower halls.

Pop, Crackle, and Snap threw torches into the kitchen draperies, turning the side hall into an inferno. The fire forced Hollowborn out into the open where Danin skewered one, and Ethra’s specter form drove another mad until it tore at its own flesh.

Yet the Dominators’ chants were relentless. Guards turned on their comrades—Malk drove a spear into Jarthan, and Malen fell weeping as he strangled Belm at the Dominators’ command.

Velexia cut through two Veilshifters, her blade burning green, but Kaelra, newly roused from unconsciousness, was struck down before she could stand beside her.

### **Phase III: Turning the Tide**

For a moment, the Stronghold bent but did not break.

- Korin, mounted on his warhorse, led a countercharge into the Sanctifiers’ flank. His lance pierced a Bulwark’s throat, and his warhorse trampled a Penitent into the cobblestone.
    
- Ellis unleashed another scream, annihilating two Dominators at once.
    
- Gravik and Danin rallied the veterans, pinning the Bladedancers long enough for Thorne to drive a dagger through one’s spine.

But then, horror: Garrik, fell beneath Hollowborn claws, and Bemar was crushed beneath a Bulwark’s hammer.

---

### **Phase IV: The Courtyard Slaughter**

The courtyard became a charnel house.

- Wex fell to a Bladedancer’s blade.
    
- Kell and Marni were gutted by Hollowborn shadows.
    
- Roghera the Wight was shattered by a Dominator’s holy curse, his undead form reduced to ash.

Councilor Varn Drest watched from his balcony. When Velexia glanced up, needing his command, she saw him turn away and slip into the keep’s back halls, vanishing without a word.

---

### **Phase V: Velexia’s Last Stand**

By dawn, only a fraction remained: Velexia, Korin, Rex, Danin, Borin Scaletooth, Thorne, Ellis the ghost, Dreson the spy, and a handful of battered guards. Against them, fewer than ten Sanctifiers remained—two Bulwarks, a Dominator, and four Hollowborn.

The Dominator raised his hand, chanting his final curse. Korin gasped and turned his sword on himself, dying with a ragged sob. Rex lunged to avenge him but was crushed beneath the Bulwarks’ shields.

Ellis hurled himself into the Hollowborn, screaming until his spectral form unraveled completely—dragging two of them with him into nothingness.

Velexia, bloodied and barely standing, struck down the Dominator with her jade sword. Borin Scaletooth was slain, Thorne’s throat torn out—but Velexia rose one last time against the last Bulwark.

With a roar, she drove her sword through the sanctified steel and split the man in two. The final Sanctifier fell.

---

### **The End**

Smoke hung thick. Bodies—friend and foe alike—lay heaped across the courtyard.

Velexia stood swaying, her blade cracked, her armor shattered, one arm hanging limp and broken. She spat blood onto the stones and whispered:

“Stronghold… still stands.”

Behind her, only fragments of her force remained—three guards too injured to lift a sword, and the goblin Pop, dragging himself out of the ashes.

Kovinar's allies: Dreson (the spy), Thorne (Bandit Captain) crawling into the woods...clinging to life, 

Drest was gone. The Sanctifiers were annihilated.

### **Fate of Councilor Varn Drest**

Slipped away unseen into the tunnel beneath the Stronghold—his whereabouts unknown.
