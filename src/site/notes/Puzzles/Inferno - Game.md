_A D12 Gambling Game for the Truly Damned_

---

**Overview**  
Inferno is a fast-paced, high-stakes dice game inspired by the Nine Hells. Players wager gold, roll a d12, and try to survive the rising inferno—while waiting for just the right moment to betray their “friends.”

After a round, others make their moves in turn order, to simulate multiple events happening at one time.

### 🎲 How to Play

**What You Need:**

- One d12
    
- At least 2 players (more = longer game)
    
- A set amount of gold for the **ante**
    

---

### 🔥 Basic Rules

1. **All players ante** (e.g., 10 gp).
    
2. **Inferno starts at 3.** This is the number to beat.
    
3. **On your turn, roll a d12.**
    
    - If you roll **equal to or above** the inferno, you’re safe.
        
    - If you roll **below**, you’re out—**unless** you pay the ante again to try **one** re-roll.
        
    - **If you roll a 1**, you are instantly out. No re-roll.
        
    - **If you roll a 12**, you’re safe this turn **and** automatically succeed next turn.
        
4. After every full round where all players succeed **or** someone is eliminated, the inferno increases by 1.
    
5. The last player standing wins the pot.

### 🩸 Betrayal (Once Per Player)

- Once per game, a player may **force another player to re-roll** a successful roll.
    
- Cannot be used on a 12.
    
- Only **one betrayal** may be used per turn.
    
- If the betrayed player fails, they may still pay the ante and attempt one re-roll (unless they roll a 1).
