| **1** | **Cold, red gelatin** that never stops jiggling.  <br>✨ Gain **1d8 temporary HP**. 😨 For the next hour, you have **disadvantage on Insight checks** as your vision warps slightly.                                                                                                                                                               |
| **2** | **Unidentifiable gray meat** with a texture that fights back. [[06_NPCs/Magda Velt, The Lunch Matron\|Magda Velt, The Lunch Matron]] offers to let you take it to go. <br>🛡️ **Cure one condition** affecting you (**charmed, frightened, or poisoned**). 😖 You suffer **recurring flashbacks** of being force-fed—**disadvantage on Constitution saves** until your next short rest. |
| **3** | **Bright green soup** that tastes like nothing and leaves your tongue numb.  <br>💉 Regain **2d8 HP**. 🤐 You are **unable to speak for 10 minutes** (no verbal spell components).                                                                                                                                                                |
| **4** | A **perfectly clean plate** that you instinctively choose not to dirty.  <br>🧠 Gain **no HP**, but hear a whisper: _“That was polite of you.”_  <br>☠️ The next time you face **Nerull’s Trial**, you may **roll with advantage (6d20) once** during the bargaining.                                                                             |
