### Actions

**Memory Lash.** _Melee Spell Attack:_ +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target.  
Hit: 3d10 psychic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or lose their reaction until the start of their next turn.

**Fracture the Mind (Recharge 5–6).** Each creature of Miren’s choice within 30 feet must make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 6d6 psychic damage and sees a vivid, personal hallucination (disadvantage on ability checks for 1 minute). Success halves damage and negates the hallucination.

### Bonus Actions

**Echo of the Forgotten.** Miren teleports up to 30 ft. to an unoccupied space she can see, leaving behind a flickering afterimage. Until the start of her next turn, attacks against her have disadvantage.

### Passive Effects

**Dream-State Aura.** While below half HP, the air warps around her. All Wisdom (Insight) and Intelligence (Investigation) checks within 20 feet are made with disadvantage. Enemy concentration checks are also made with disadvantage.
