"Strangers on the edge of shadow, you venture where few dare tread. I wondered when you might arrive. Where you stand marks the boundary between life and death, between knowledge and the secrets that lie beyond the veil. You are foolish for coming here. No unpossessed soul survives in this place without cunning. However, being clever carries its own burden. What is your purpose in this unholy place?"

"Ah, seekers of truth, you wish to know the path to Xaphan. But understand this: where he is is less important than who he is to Nerull. He is not one reached by mortal steps alone. The place where Xaphan is held exists beyond the Veil."

"Once, long ago, I had a name—soft as morning dew, full of warmth and laughter. But for now… you may simply call me The Oracle. I exist in Elarith between the shadows of life and death, undetectable to Nerull's gaze… intangible to his grasp. In this realm, I am neither alive nor dead. I am neither here nor there. I observe, I guide, but the prophecy you’re fulfilling was forged long ago by hands more skilled than mine."


"Yes, I know Xaphan. We have been connected for as long as I can remember. He was brought here 1,600 years ago, summoned from the overworld by the will of a Demilich, a master of shadows and echoes of the past. Xaphan tempted me with promises and dreams, of a time when paths would converge under a banner of grace. But centuries have passed and I’ve grown to believe that such things are whispers from the wind… and not beyond the veil."

"Oh, you seek the guidance of the Death-Wrought Mosaic, hoping it may illuminate your way. Tread carefully, as the **roll/role** of fate’s dice is to also cast shadows upon your path. Yes, yes, I see them. Four in total, but … one in your grasp. Where are its sisters? Ah, with the sisters, yes, Tisiphone, Hecate, and Nyx. Together they make the Death-Wrought Mosaic. But they can only guide you to The Veil. To speak with it… through it… you need more guidance than Xaphan can provide. That wizard is more chaos than cunning. You would do well to… stay in touch."

"Hear my words: not all that seeks to harm you is your enemy, and not all who offer aid are your friends. This place has mystery all around you. See with your mind, as well as your eyes. Use wisdom and be intentional. Look for details… the little things. Look at the forest AND the trees."
