### Traits

**Innate Spellcasting (Sorcery).** Velura’s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 15, +7 to hit with spell attacks). She requires no material components when she casts spells.  

**Fey-Tinged Magic.** Spells Velura casts that charm, frighten, or create illusions are made with disadvantage on saving throws.  

**Tisiphone’s Blessing (Radiant Shield).** When Velura or an ally within 10 ft. is hit by an attack, she can use her reaction to reduce the damage by 10 (radiant) as shimmering scales of light deflect the blow.
