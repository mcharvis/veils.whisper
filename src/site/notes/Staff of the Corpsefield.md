_Wondrous Item, Very Rare, Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster_

A staff of twisted bone and steel, its head a tangle of vertebrae fused into a claw that grips a shard of green jade. The shaft hums faintly with whispers when thrust into soil littered with corpses.

**Optional Effects**

- **Harvest Life.** When a creature within 30 ft dies, you may use your reaction to siphon its departing essence. You gain **temporary HP equal to its CR or level.**
    
- **Grave Conduit.** As an action, you may impale the staff into the ground. For 1 minute, any undead you control within 30 ft allow you to gain **+2 AC now and +2 to damage rolls on your next turn.** 
    
- **Sepulchral Veil**, Once per long rest, as a reaction when targeted by an attack, you vanish into a swirl of ghostly corpses. You **become incorporeal until the start of your next turn**, taking half damage from all sources.

Each time you use an effect of the staff, **roll a d6** up to 3d6.
