_Wondrous Item, Very Rare, Requires Attunement by a Spellcaster_

A staff of twisted bone and steel, its head a tangle of vertebrae fused into a claw that grips a shard of green jade. The shaft hums faintly with whispers when thrust into soil littered with corpses.

**Properties**

- **Corpsefield Mastery.** While holding the staff, you can use an action once per long rest to animate up to **6 corpses** within 30 ft. They rise as zombies under your control (half HP, AC 8, mob rules). This does not count against your normal _Animate Dead_ limit.
    
- **Harvest Life.** When a creature within 30 ft dies, you may use your reaction to siphon its departing essence. You gain **temporary HP equal to the creatureâ€™s level/CR**.
    
- **Dark Call.** Once per day, as an action, you may call to the corpsefield. All undead within 60 ft immediately kneel to you and will not attack until you release them. Lasts 1 minute.
    

Each time you use Corpsefield Mastery or Dark Call, **roll a d6**.
