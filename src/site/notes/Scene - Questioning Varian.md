### **The Scene**

The party is ushered into the main hall. Varian is shuttled of into an adjacent room, Velexia stands stiff-backed, arms crossed. Drest lounges nearby, his smile thin as a blade. Varian is the unspoken center of attention.

**Drest’s Opening **  
“Varian, have a seat. We have some questions… some concerns. You’ve returned under unusual circumstances, and it is only fair that both Commander Velexia and I hear your account in full.”

**Velexia’s Opening **  
- **Arrived with party:** 
	- "You survived Ya’a Thalor, Varian. Jonah and Jeremy, did not. You were hired to guard our interests, yet you return at the side of outsiders. Explain yourself.”

**Drest’s Probe **  
- **Arrived with party:** ““Tell me, Varian—while you served with these adventurers, did you keep your eyes sharp? Did they treat you as a companion… or as a soldier in _our_ employ?”

**Velexia’s Test **  
“If I were to order you against these adventurers now, would you draw your blade—or hesitate?”  

#### **Varian leans Double Agent (admits or hints he was watching, plays both sides, slippery loyalty):**

- **Velexia:** “So you were a leash on *them*. Then I expect you to exploit every crack in their armor. Do not fail to deliver.”
    
- **Drest:** “Yes, yes. A shadow in their midst. That is precisely what I hoped. You see, Varian, loyalty comes in many shapes. Continue to prove yours… and you may yet find yourself...indispensable. You're free to go.”
