### The Workings

I’ve checked each tunnel. Every chamber holds **all four ores** — iron in rough plates, silver tracing the quartz, thin lines of gold hugging the hottest stone, and Bloodfire shards jutting out like burning teeth. The question isn’t _which ore is where_, but how dangerous it is to dig each section.

- **Northern Chambers (upper caverns):**  
    Shard growth here is strongest — the red crystals burn the air and warp the timbers. Iron and silver are steady, gold is thin but present. 
    - NEEDS: Otherwise, the men won’t last long. 
	    - **150 gp: new bracing** 
		- **80 gp: ventilation bellows**
    
    - Potential Yield: 
	    - Iron: Average
	    - Silver: Average
	    - Gold: Poor
	    - [[Bloodfire Shards\|Bloodfire Shards]]: Rich 
    
- **Central Spur (main rail fork):**  
    This is the heart of the works. Ore is mixed but balanced — silver shows cleanly, iron is easy, shards smaller but safer to collect. The broken rails choke cart movement.
    - NEEDS: 
	    - **240 gp: new ties and wheels for a broken minecart**. 
    
    - Potential Yield: 
	    - Iron: Average
	    - Silver: Average
	    - Gold: Average
	    - [[Bloodfire Shards\|Bloodfire Shards]]: Poor 
    
- **Western Chamber (side cavern with timber frame):**  
    Iron dominates here, with silver lacing and a few stubborn shards. Timbers are cracked and the bend of the cartway makes derailments likely. 
    - NEEDS:
	    - **175 gp: fresh wedges and braces** to keep stable. 
		
    - Potential Yield: 
	    - Iron: Rich
	    - Silver: Poor
	    - Gold: None
	    - [[Bloodfire Shards\|Bloodfire Shards]]: Poor 
    
- **Lower Tunnels (near lava flow):**  
    All ores appear, but heat drives the gold into fragile seams and shards into dangerous clusters. The air is thin and carts scorch their wheels. Without the **ventilation system** (same 80 gp bellows and ducting), this level is death to miners. With it, the chambers could be worked with a chance of sudden finds.
    - NEEDS:
		- **80 gp: ventilation bellows**
		
    - Potential Yield: 
	    - Iron: Average
	    - Silver: Average
	    - Gold: Average
	    - [[Bloodfire Shards\|Bloodfire Shards]]: Poor but there is potential for more with new mines.

### People & Payroll

Current workforce:

- **15 miners:** 15 miners × 10 gp/wk = **150 gp/wk**
- **6 engineers** (on carts and rails): 6 engineers × 15 gp = **90 gp/wk**
- **3 prisoners** shackled near the barracks
- **1 foreman (myself)**: 25 gp/wk

**Weekly Costs (as it stands):**

- Miners: 150 gp/wk
- Engineers: 90 gp/wk
- Foreman (me): 25 gp/wk
- Supplies (food, oil, tools): 75 gp/wk
- Prisoner rations: 3 gp/wk  

**Total: ~ 343 gp/week**

### Mine Security (Needed)

With shards glowing like lanterns and gold dust sticking to boots, theft is a certainty. Recommend 4-6 guards (15 gp/week each)** to patrol rails and hoists.

**Total: ~ 60-90 gp/week**

---

### Taxes 

- **Mad King’s Cut:** 10% of gross profits.

---

### Transport & Protection

- **Caravans:** Hauling ore to VE costs ~**25 gp per 50 lb** by mule, more if guarded wagons are used.
	- 600 lb = 300 gp
    
- **Escorts:** Mercenaries charge **15 gp/week per head**; expect at least 4–6 for a caravan.
	- 60-90 gp/week
    
- **Bandit Toll:** If unescorted, roll a d6: on 1–2, **bandits steal d100%** of that week’s shipment.

---

### Ore Type/Quality
- **Ore Type (value per pound):**
    - Iron: 1 gp/lb
    - Silver: 5 gp/lb
    - Gold: 50 gp/lb
    - [[Bloodfire Shards\|Bloodfire Shards]]: 100+ gp/lb
    

- **Quality (how much can be pulled each week per miner):**
    - Poor: 1d4 lbs
    - Average: 1d6 lbs
    - Rich: 2d6 lbs
    - Legendary: 4d6 lbs
    
---

### Refining

Selling ore raw yields **half value**. A **smelter (20 gp/week)** and a **bloomery with crucibles (1000 gp one-time)** will double profits, especially on silver, gold, and shards.

##### **Smelter Capacity (one bloomery with crucibles + one smelter)**

- Can refine **about 100 units of ore per day**, **600 units per week**.
- Different ores take more time:
    - **Iron:** 1 lb counts as 1 unit
    - **Silver/Gold:** 1 lb counts as 2 units
    - **Bloodfire Shards:** 1 lb counts as 4 units

So in practice:
- **600 lb of iron/week**, or
- **300 lb of silver or gold/week**, or
- **150 lb of Bloodfire/week**,  
    or any mix that adds up to the weekly 600-lb limit.

Anything above that has to be sold raw at half value or stockpiled.

### Potential Yield
- **Iron**
    - Poor: 1d4 lbs × 1 gp/lb = **1–4 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**15–60 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Average: 1d6 lbs × 1 gp/lb = **1–6 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**15–90 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Rich: 2d6 lbs × 1 gp/lb = **2–12 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**30–180 gp/week for 15 miners**)
- **Silver**
    - Poor: 1d4 lbs × 5 gp/lb = **5–20 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**75–300 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Average: 1d6 lbs × 5 gp/lb = **5–30 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**75–450 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Rich: 2d6 lbs × 5 gp/lb = **10–60 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**150–900 gp/week for 15 miners**)
- **Gold**
    - Poor: 1d4 lbs × 50 gp/lb = **50–200 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**750–3,000 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Average: 1d6 lbs × 50 gp/lb = **50–300 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**750–4,500 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Rich: 2d6 lbs × 50 gp/lb = **100–600 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**1,500–9,000 gp/week for 15 miners**
- **Bloodfire Shards**
    - Poor: 1d4 lbs × 100 gp/lb = **100–400 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**1,500–6,000 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Average: 1d6 lbs × 100 gp/lb = **100–600 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**1,500–9,000 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Rich: 2d6 lbs × 100 gp/lb = **200–1,200 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**3,000–18,000 gp/week for 15 miners**)

### Prisoners

Three captives remain chained in the barracks. Their presence sours morale. You must choose:

- **Hire them** (gain +3 miners, morale boost).
- **Release/banish** (save costs now, but they know about the mines).
- **Keep imprisoned** (sabotage/disease risk).
- **Eliminate them** (save costs, but lose moral)

---

### My Recommendations

To turn this from a death-trap into a working mine:

1. **150 gp** for timbers (north & west chambers).
2. **120 gp** for rail and wheel replacements (central spur).
3. **80 gp** for bellows and ducting (north & lower tunnels).
4. **240 gp**: new ties and wheels for a broken minecart
5. **175 gp:** fresh wedges and braces to keep stable. 
6. **1,000 gp** for bloomery and crucibles, plus **20 gp/week** for a smelter.
7. **Hire 4-6 guards (15 gp/week/per guard each).**
8. Decide the fate of the **prisoners**.

**Total Immediate costs:** 1,765 gp  
**Potential weekly revenue:** 40–60 gp/week

# Weekly Costs (with recommended hires & operations)

- **Labor:**
    - Miners (15): 150 gp
    - Engineers (6): 90 gp
    - Foreman: 25 gp
    - Supplies: 75 gp
    - Prisoners: 3 gp
    
    - **Subtotal Labor = 343 gp**
    
- **Security:** Guards (4–6): 60–90 gp
- **Smelter:** 20 gp + fuel (≈10 gp/week)
- **Transport:** 300 gp for a 600-lb load (if fully refined and shipped)
- **Escort:** 60–90 gp
- **Taxes:** 10% gross (before costs)

**Typical Costs Weekly = 793–856 gp + 10% tax**  
(assuming 600 lb shipped with guards & smelting).

---

### Sample Revenues (if smelted & sold)

- **Iron (Average, 15 miners):** ~52 gp/week gross → loss after costs.
- **Silver (Average, 15 miners):** ~262 gp/week gross → still loss after costs.
- **Gold (Average, 15 miners):** ~1,875 gp/week gross → **~1,020 gp net profit** after costs.
- **Bloodfire (Average, 15 miners):** ~3,750 gp/week gross → **~2,500 gp net profit** after costs.

---

### Key Insight

- Iron & Silver **won’t cover payroll**; they’re filler ore.
- Gold and especially Bloodfire **carry the mine**.
- Costs scale hard: guards, caravans, taxes. That forces **risk-reward decisions**:
    - Push miners into dangerous Bloodfire shafts → big profit, big risk.
    - Stick to Silver/Iron → steady work, steady losses.
    - Expand workforce → higher costs, but can feed more ore to smelter.
- New mines can be built to find more supply or new ores, but it would require capital.
