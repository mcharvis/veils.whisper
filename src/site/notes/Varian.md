Varian – The Relentless Blade

Few in the realm know Varian’s true origin, and fewer still live to speak of it. Born in the shadowed borderlands where warlords traded power in blood, Varian’s earliest memories are of steel clashing and the smell of burning earth. His parents—simple farmers—were cut down in a raid when he was no more than six. He would have perished too, had a figure known only as [[The Black Wolf\|The Black Wolf]] not taken him.

[[The Black Wolf\|The Black Wolf]] was no mere sellsword, but a legendary warrior whose name was whispered as a curse on battlefields. Seeing something cold and unyielding in the boy’s eyes, he brought Varian into a hidden brotherhood—an order of master warriors who honed their skills far from the eyes of kings and common folk. Over years, Varian was forged, not raised. His masters were killers, tacticians, and champions—each one unmatched in a different art of war: the precision of the duelist’s blade, the raw fury of the berserker, the patience of the marksman.

They taught him discipline beyond mortal limits, but not kindness. They taught him loyalty only to the mission, not to any cause.

When he was grown, his final trial was to be sent alone into the heart of a war. The mission was simple: eliminate the enemy commander and return. Varian did not fail. He never has.

Now, he moves through the world as a weapon given flesh—stoic, unreadable, and relentless. His voice is calm, his gaze cold, and his will unshakable. He does not fight for glory, nor for ideals, but for the completion of the task before him. Whether the mission comes from a noble court, a desperate villager, or a shadowed employer, it matters little.

Varian is willing to work alongside others, but only so far as they prove useful. Trust is not something he offers—only respect earned through competence. Those who stand in his way do not stand for long.

Some whisper that his old masters still watch him from the dark, ensuring their blade remains sharp. Others believe he has surpassed them all and now answers to no one.

Only Varian knows the truth. And he isn’t telling.
