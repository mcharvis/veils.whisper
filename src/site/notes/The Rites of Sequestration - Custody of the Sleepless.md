A thick, rectangular volume bound in warped, grey-green leather, cracked and faded. It smells faintly of dried blood and old stone. The cover is unlabeled, but the spine says “The Rites of Sequestration.” The clasp is a loop of wrought iron. The pages are made of pressed bark, darkened with ritual ash and stitched with thin red thread. Margins are filled with handwritten annotations, sometimes in two different hands, arguing quietly in notes.

*This page is looser and newer than the others, as if added after the book was written.* 

> **Only one may be opened first. The Sleepless will stir if you choose wrong.**
> *The one entombed with the key is not honored, but kept.* 
> *He wrote of the girl's arrival, but he was not a witness—he was to blame.*
> *His name lies carved in stone with the rest, but no light shines favorably on him.*
> Find the one who wrote of the girl. His tomb holds the key. Open the others after.
