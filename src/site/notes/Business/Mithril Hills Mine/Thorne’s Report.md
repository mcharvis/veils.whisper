### The Workings

I’ve checked each tunnel. Every chamber holds **all four ores** — iron in rough plates, silver tracing the quartz, thin lines of gold hugging the hottest stone, and Bloodfire shards jutting out like burning teeth. The question isn’t _which ore is where_, but how dangerous it is to dig each section.

- **Northern Chambers (upper caverns):**  
    Shard growth here is strongest — the red crystals burn the air and warp the timbers. Iron and silver are steady, gold is thin but present. 
    - NEEDS: Otherwise, the men won’t last long. 
	    - **150 gp: new bracing** 
		- **80 gp: ventilation bellows**
    
    - Potential Yield: 
	    - Iron: Average
	    - Silver: Average
	    - Gold: Poor
	    - [[Bloodfire Shards\|Bloodfire Shards]]: Rich 
    
- **Central Spur (main rail fork):**  
    This is the heart of the works. Ore is mixed but balanced — silver shows cleanly, iron is easy, shards smaller but safer to collect. The broken rails choke cart movement.
    - NEEDS: 
	    - **240 gp: new ties and wheels for a broken minecart**. 
    
    - Potential Yield: 
	    - Iron: Average
	    - Silver: Average
	    - Gold: Average
	    - [[Bloodfire Shards\|Bloodfire Shards]]: Poor 
    
- **Lower Tunnels (near lava flow):**  
    All ores appear, but heat drives the gold into fragile seams and shards into dangerous clusters. The air is thin and carts scorch their wheels. Without the **ventilation system** (same 80 gp bellows and ducting), this level is death to miners. With it, the chambers could be worked with a chance of sudden finds.
    - NEEDS:
		- **80 gp: ventilation bellows**
		- **175 gp: fresh wedges and braces** to keep stable. 
    - Potential Yield: 
	    - Iron: Average
	    - Silver: Average
	    - Gold: Average
	    - [[Bloodfire Shards\|Bloodfire Shards]]: Poor but there is potential for more with new mines.

### Mining/Constructing new spaces

- Requires engineer evaluation: 90 gp

- One miner can clear and brace one 5×5×5 block in 3 days, costing about 30 gp (10gp x 3 days). Scale up by miners for speed.
	- Rule of Thumb (Rooms & Hallways)
		- **10×10 room (10 ft tall):**
			- 8 blocks = **240 gp**, **24 miner-days**
	        - With 8 miners = ~3 days
		- **20×20 room (10 ft tall):**
			- 32 blocks = **960 gp**, **96 miner-days**
            - With 16 miners = ~6 days
		- **5×5×10 hallway segment (10 ft tall, 5 ft long):**
	        - 2 stacked blocks = **60 gp**, **6 miner-days**
            - With 6 miners = 1 day

- Creating a functional room will require masons.
- One mason can build one 5×5×10 wall in 1 day, costing about 30 gp (10gp x 3 days). Scale up by miners for speed.
	- Rooms are 10 ft high.
	- Rule of Thumb (Masons)
		- **10×10 room (10 ft tall):**
		    - Needs **four interior walls × 10 ft wide × 10 ft tall.**
			- That’s **8 wall segments** (two per wall).
	        - **8 mason-days**, **80 gp**.
			- With 4 masons: **2 days**.
        - **20×20 room (10 ft tall):**
	        - Four walls × 20 ft wide × 10 ft tall.
	        - Each wall = **8 segments** → **32 segments total.**
            - **32 mason-days**, **320 gp**.
            - With 8 masons: **4 days**.
        - **5×5×10 hallway (10 ft tall, 5 ft long):**
	        - Two long walls + two short end walls = **4 wall segments.**
            - **4 mason-days**, **40 gp**.
            - With 4 masons: **1 day**.

We will need more miners and masons to expand.

### People & Payroll

Current workforce:

- **15 miners:** 15 miners × 10 gp/wk = **150 gp/wk**
- **6 engineers** (on carts and rails): 6 engineers × 15 gp = **90 gp/wk**
- **0 Masons:** 0 masons x 10 gp/wk = 0 gp/wk
- **3 prisoners** shackled near the barracks
- **1 foreman (myself)**: 25 gp/wk

**Weekly Costs (as it stands):**

- Miners: 150 gp/wk
- Engineers: 90 gp/wk
- Masons: 0 gp/wk
- Foreman (me): 25 gp/wk
- Supplies (food, oil, tools): 3 gp/wk/soul 

**Total: ~ 343 gp/week**

### Mine Security (Needed)

With shards glowing like lanterns and gold dust sticking to boots, theft is a certainty. Recommend **4-6 guards (25 gp/week each)** to patrol rails and hoists.

**Total: ~ 100-150 gp/week**

---

### Taxes 

- **Kingdom of Ahrown:** 20% of gross profits.

---

### Transport & Protection

- **Caravans:** Hauling ore to VE costs ~**1 gp per 1 lb** by mule, more if guarded wagons are used.
	- Max/Load: 300 lb = 300 gp
    
- **Escorts:** Mercenaries charge **50 gp/week per head**; expect at least 4–6 for a caravan.
	- 200-300 gp/week
    
- **Bandit Toll:** If unescorted, roll a d6: on 1–2, **bandits steal d100%** of that week’s shipment.

---

### Ore Type/Quality
- **Ore Type (value per pound):**
    - Iron: 1 gp/lb
    - Silver: 5 gp/lb
    - Gold: 50 gp/lb
    - [[Bloodfire Shards\|Bloodfire Shards]]: 100 gp/lb
    

- **Quality (how much can be pulled each week per miner):**
    - Poor: 1d4 lbs
    - Average: 1d6 lbs
    - Rich: 2d6 lbs
    
---

### Refining

Selling ore raw yields **half value**. A **smelter (300 gp/week)** and a **bloomery with crucibles (1000 gp one-time)** will double profits, especially on silver, gold, and shards. We need to build a smelting room. 

***Halric's alchemists were using refined Bloodfire Shards to discover/create magical substances. There are some alchemy notes to review.***


##### **Smelter Capacity (one bloomery with crucibles + one smelter)**

- Can refine **about 50 units of ore per day**, **300 units per week**.
- Different ores take more time:
    - **Iron:** 1 lb counts as 1 unit
    - **Silver/Gold:** 1 lb counts as 2 units
    - **Bloodfire Shards:** 1 lb counts as 4 units

So in practice:
- **300 lb of iron/week**, or
- **150 lb of silver or gold/week**, or
- **75 lb of Bloodfire/week**,  
    or any mix that adds up to the weekly 300-lb limit.

Anything above that has to be sold raw at half value or stockpiled.

---

### Potential Yield
- **Iron**
    - Poor: 1d4 lbs × 1 gp/lb = **1–4 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**15–60 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Average: 1d6 lbs × 1 gp/lb = **1–6 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**15–90 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Rich: 2d6 lbs × 1 gp/lb = **2–12 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**30–180 gp/week for 15 miners**)
- **Silver**
    - Poor: 1d4 lbs × 5 gp/lb = **5–20 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**75–300 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Average: 1d6 lbs × 5 gp/lb = **5–30 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**75–450 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Rich: 2d6 lbs × 5 gp/lb = **10–60 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**150–900 gp/week for 15 miners**)
- **Gold**
    - Poor: 1d4 lbs × 50 gp/lb = **50–200 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**750–3,000 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Average: 1d6 lbs × 50 gp/lb = **50–300 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**750–4,500 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Rich: 2d6 lbs × 50 gp/lb = **100–600 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**1,500–9,000 gp/week for 15 miners**
- **Bloodfire Shards**
    - Poor: 1d4 lbs × 100 gp/lb = **100–400 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**1,500–6,000 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Average: 1d6 lbs × 100 gp/lb = **100–600 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**1,500–9,000 gp/week for 15 miners**)
    - Rich: 2d6 lbs × 100 gp/lb = **200–1,200 gp/week/miner** 
	    - (**3,000–18,000 gp/week for 15 miners**)

### Prisoners

Three (3) captives remain chained in the barracks. Their presence sours morale. You must choose:

- **Hire them** (gain +3 miners/engineers/masons, morale boost).
- **Release/banish** (save costs now, but they know about the mines).
- **Keep imprisoned** (sabotage/disease risk).
- **Eliminate them** (save costs, but lose moral)

---

### My Recommendations

To turn this from a death-trap into a working mine:

1. **150 gp** for timbers (north & west chambers).
2. **120 gp** for rail and wheel replacements (central spur).
3. **80 gp** for bellows and ducting (north & lower tunnels).
4. **240 gp**: new ties and wheels for a broken minecart
5. **175 gp:** fresh wedges and braces to keep stable. 
6. **1,000 gp** for bloomery and crucibles, plus **300 gp/week** for a smelter.
7. **Hire 4-6 guards (25 gp/week/per guard each).**
8. Decide the fate of the **prisoners**.

**Total Immediate costs:** 1,765 gp

### Key Insight

- Iron & Silver **won’t cover payroll**; they’re filler ore.
- Gold and especially Bloodfire **carry the mine**.
- Costs scale hard: guards, caravans, taxes. That forces **risk-reward decisions**:
    - Push miners into dangerous Bloodfire shafts → big profit, big risk.
    - Stick to Silver/Iron → steady work, steady losses.
    - Expand workforce → higher costs, but can feed more ore to smelter.
- New mines can be built to find more supply or new ores, but it would require capital.
