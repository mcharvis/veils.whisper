## 🔮 Words from an Oracle
> These are whispers and visions that have emerged but may not yet be understood.

- "The place where Xaphan is held exists beyond the Veil."
- "In this realm, I am neither alive...nor dead. I am neither here nor there. I observe, I guide, but the prophecy you’re fulfilling was forged long ago by hands more skilled than mine."
- [[What is the Veil?\|What is the Veil?]]
- "Xaphan tempted me with promises and dreams, of a time when paths would converge under a banner of grace. But centuries have passed and I’ve grown to believe that such things are whispers from the wind...and not beyond the veil."
- [[Items/Magical/Death-Wrought Mosaic\|Death-Wrought Mosaic]]
- "Hear my words: not all that seeks to harm you is your enemy, and not all who offer aid are your friends. This place has mystery all around you. See with your mind, as well as your eyes. Use wisdom and be intentional. Look for details…the little things. Look at the forest AND the trees.”
