**Young half-orc named Lurtza (AKA [Squeaks](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/87773447))**

While attempting to steal from [[06_NPCs/Zarvok\|Zarvok]], Squeaks inadvertently activated a magical trap that Zarvok had set to protect his lair. This trap was designed to catch intruders by creating a temporary portal to the overworld, acting as a failsafe to remove any unwanted visitors from his domain in [[Elarith\|Elarith]]. The trap was linked to a small, enchanted gemstone that Squeaks attempted to steal.

As soon as the gemstone was lifted, it triggered the portal, pulling both Squeaks and [[06_NPCs/Zarvok\|Zarvok]] through. Zarvok, caught off guard and unprepared for an immediate confrontation in a different plane, was momentarily disoriented. Squeaks, using her natural agility and cunning, took this opportunity to vanish into the shadows of the overworld, leaving Zarvok to face the unfamiliar terrain alone.

Upon discovering [[05_Player Characters/Inactive/Xaphan\|Xaphan]]'s practice of necromancy, she clandestinely befriended him, driven by the hope that he could resurrect her beloved pet rat, [[06_NPCs/Pets/Wilson\|Wilson]]. [[05_Player Characters/Inactive/Xaphan\|Xaphan]] successfully revived Wilson, and over time, he became accustomed to reattaching the rat's little body parts whenever necessary. 

During her ongoing adventures, she stumbled upon a plot to summon Xaphan back to [[02_World/Obsidian Lands of Volencia/Necromanteion\|Necromanteion]]. Grateful for his help with Wilson, she discreetly informed Xaphan of the impending danger. With this knowledge, Xaphan began devising a plan to free himself from the clutches of Nerull.

# **SQUEAKS — CLEAN CANON BACKSTORY
# **SQUEAKS — CLEAN, FLOWING NARRATIVE**

From her first breath, she bore the mark of difference—smaller than her kin, with her father’s sharp features and a frame that could never match the hulking warriors around her. In the warband, strength was survival, and weakness was death.

She survived not by brute force but by speed, cunning, and silence. While her kin bellowed in battle, Lurtza learned to slip into the shadows, striking where eyes were blind and ears were deaf. Her smallness became her weapon.

She was mocked as “runt” and “half-blood,” but when supplies vanished without trace or enemy scouts fell with blades in their backs, the warband began to whisper her true name, Whisperfang—meant as an insult, but earned all the same.

Even so, blood ran colder than honor among orcs. Her mixed heritage kept her at arm’s length, never fully trusted. The moment her father’s name was spat on and her mother’s warband turned against her, Lurtza slipped away under cover of night, carrying nothing but her daggers and a tiny rat she had raised from a runt’s litter.

Wilson was the only creature that had never treated her as less.

## **WILSON’S DEATH AND RETURN**

For years, Wilson traveled with her—quick, clever, and loyal. Until one winter raid took him from her, caught in a trap meant for larger prey.

She buried him with trembling hands, whispering a vow that the world would never again take the one bond she trusted.

Fate—or something darker—listened.

Xaphan, a fire genasi necromancer with equal parts arrogance and curiosity, took pity on her desperation. In exchange for her help acquiring certain relics, he drew Wilson back from the dead.

Nights later, the rat clawed his way from the shallow earth, eyes faintly glowing, ribs showing through thin fur. Undead, yet loyal still.

For Lurtza, it was not a curse.  
It was proof that her bond with Wilson defied even death.

---

## **THE ROGUES’ CREW — AND THE MAKING OF “SQUEAKS”**

Lurtza wandered for years with Wilson on her shoulder and daggers at her side, surviving but hollow.

Until she fell in with a ragtag crew of rogues: pickpockets, highwaymen, spell-slingers, and outcasts like herself. They teased her relentlessly for her tiny, high-pitched voice, dubbing her “Squeaks.” At first she bristled—until she realized the laughter wasn’t cruel.

The name stuck. And for the first time, she let it.

### **Getting Her Name**

Her first night with them, she squeaked out a warning about a loose floorboard. Rurik—broad-shouldered, iron-handed, too patient for his own good—laughed and said:

“Well now, I’ve never had a rogue squeak her way into my plans before.”

She hated how warm the nickname felt.  
She loved it anyway.

---

## **THE RAID THAT MADE HER SQUEAKS**

Their biggest job was meant to change everything: a noble’s treasure caravan heavy with gold, guarded by mercenaries. For weeks they planned the strike, mapping routes and studying guard rotations.

Squeaks scouted from the rooftops, Wilson perched on her shoulder.  
“Three guards at the north gate,” she whispered. “Two at the rear. I can slip past them, but I’ll need someone covering the back.”

“Aye, little squeak,” Rurik murmured, stepping beside her. “Lead the way. Just… try not to squeak too loudly.”

She grinned despite herself.

The crew moved like phantoms—Fingers disabling traps with flair, Kael stalking shadows with an arrow always ready, Morrie muttering spells under her breath, Bram hauling supplies and blocking narrow passages with sheer size.

They reached the caravan under starlight. The first locks clicked open under Squeaks’ hands.

Then the alarm tripped.

Bells clanged. Torches flared. Mercenaries surged from every direction.

Squeaks darted through chaos, Wilson nipping at ankles. Rurik cut down foes beside her, shouting encouragement between blows.

“You’re living up to your name tonight, Squeaks! Keep squeaking—I’ll know exactly where you are!”

She squeaked back—half laugh, half panic.

But the tide turned ruthlessly.

A collapsing beam crushed Fingers.  
A bolt dropped Kael.  
Morrie’s fireball saved Squeaks but sealed her own escape.  
Bram stood like a wall until they overwhelmed him.

Rurik fought like a storm. When he fell, he smiled up at Squeaks—trusting her, urging her to live.

By dawn, she stood alone among the bodies of the only family she had ever chosen.

She buried them each with a stolen coin pressed into the earth.

And from that day forward, every job she pulled sent coin to their families—anonymous purses delivered to widows, children, aging parents.

Her daggers carried vengeance.  
Her heart carried ghosts.

## **A RAT WORTH RAISING**

The tavern was loud with laughter and the stink of sweat, ale, and stale smoke. At the far end of the bar sat a small, ragged half-orc woman clutching something wrapped in a scrap of linen. Her red eyes were glassy from tears, her voice a rasp from hours of begging. “Please,” Squeaks said to the man beside her—a necromancer whose breath reeked of grave dust and cheap gin. “I’ll pay anything. Just bring him back.” The necromancer snorted, swirling his drink. “Girl, I don’t waste reagents on rats.” “He’s not just a rat!” she shot back, trembling. “He’s Wilson!” “Even worse,” the man muttered, slamming his cup down. “Find a priest who does charity work.” He stood, muttering a curse, and shuffled toward the door. Squeaks sank forward, forehead on the bar, fingers clutching the bundle tighter. “Please… someone has to help,” she whispered. A low chuckle came from a few stools away. “Careful what you wish for, little thief. You might just get it.” She turned. The voice belonged to a tall man lounging in the shadows—a fire genasi, his skin the color of smoldering bronze and his hair flickering like a candle’s edge. Embers glowed faintly along his collarbones, pulsing in rhythm with his heartbeat. He lifted his drink lazily, the light from his fingers catching in the glass. “You’ve been crying over a corpse for an hour. I was starting to think you’d drown it in your own tears before I could finish my ale.” Squeaks glared, shoulders squared despite her exhaustion. “You a necromancer too?” The man tilted his head. “Depends on who’s asking.” “Someone desperate.” That made him smile—sharp, foxlike. “Then yes. Xaphan of...nevermind, it doesn't matter.” He rose smoothly and moved closer, the air around him carrying a faint heat. “Tell me, who’s worth all this misery?” Her voice softened. “Wilson.” He leaned an elbow on the bar, feigning interest. “And what, pray tell, is Wilson?” Squeaks swallowed hard, unwrapping the bundle. A small, lifeless rat lay curled inside, its fur matted but carefully combed. The tavern’s chatter stumbled into silence for a moment. Someone snorted. Another cackled. Xaphan blinked, then exhaled slowly through his nose. “…Ah. I see.” “Don’t mock me,” she said, voice shaking. “He was with me through everything. When my friends died, when I had no one—he stayed. He’s all I have left.” Instead of laughing, Xaphan regarded her quietly. The flame in his hair dimmed a little. “You begged another necromancer before me, didn’t you?” She nodded miserably. “He said I was crazy.” “Well,” Xaphan murmured, “he’s not entirely wrong.” Her eyes flashed with anger, but before she could snap back, he added, “But the world needs its share of the unhinged. Keeps things interesting.” He straightened, tossing a few gold coins on the counter. “Come. I’ll take a look.” Outside, the night was cool and damp. Xaphan knelt in the dirt beside the tavern, drawing sigils that smoldered orange as his fingers passed over them. His voice took on a rhythm—ancient syllables that crackled with heat instead of chill. Squeaks stood over him, wringing her hands. “You’re really doing it?” He smirked, not looking up. “You asked for a resurrection, didn’t you? You didn’t specify the size.” She hesitated, then unwrapped Wilson and placed him gently in the glowing circle. “Stay back,” Xaphan said softly. The runes flared to life, the heat shimmering in the air. His eyes glowed like twin embers as he whispered the final phrase—and with a sharp exhale, a ripple of energy surged through the ground. For a heartbeat, nothing. Then Wilson’s paw twitched. His chest rose once, twice. His eyes opened—faintly glowing red—and he let out a weak, raspy squeak. Squeaks dropped to her knees, scooping him up with trembling hands. “Wilson! You’re back! You’re really back!” Xaphan stood, brushing soot from his palms. “Congratulations,” he said dryly. “You’re now the proud owner of the world’s smallest revenant.” She ignored him, tears streaking her cheeks as Wilson crawled weakly up her sleeve to perch on her shoulder. “You’re insane,” Xaphan said at last, though his tone carried something like admiration. “But in my experience, that’s the only kind of person worth resurrecting anything for.” Squeaks grinned through her tears. “Thank you, Xaphan.” He smirked faintly, his eyes glowing like coals. “Don’t thank me yet, little rat-keeper. The living world doesn’t always welcome back what’s been stolen from the dark.” As she turned to leave, Wilson’s tail flicked across her neck. Xaphan watched them fade into the mist, the runes still glowing faintly at his feet. He murmured to himself, voice low and thoughtful. “An orc and her undead rat. Hells below, I really am losing it.”

## **THE MISCARRIAGE & THE SOUL-BINDING**

For days she wandered, clutching Wilson, silent except for the softest whispers to the rat who had been her constant companion. Her grief was deep and unrelenting. It was in a secluded glen, beneath a moonless sky, that the witch found her—a figure cloaked in midnight, her eyes sharp but compassionate. “Child of loss,” the witch said softly, “you cannot save what is gone. But perhaps what remains can be given a chance.” Squeaks shook her head, tears streaking her grime-smeared face. “He’s gone. My son… my baby… gone.” The witch knelt and placed her hands over Squeaks’ stomach, murmuring ancient words. “There is a way… but it is not simple. Another life must serve as vessel, willingly or it will be lost.” Wilson chittered softly, nuzzling Squeaks’ hand. And then, as if understanding, he bowed his tiny head. It was an unspoken pact: the rat would give his body to house the soul of the unborn child, a willing sacrifice to keep a part of both lives alive. The ritual began. Symbols glowed, air shimmered with power, and the soul of her child attempted to bind to Wilson’s small frame. But something otherworldly, something beyond even the witch’s understanding, interfered. Energy swirled violently. Sparks of crimson and violet flared. Wilson twitched and chittered, but the bond was unstable. The witch stepped back, her face pale. “It’s… incomplete. The boy’s soul cannot fully enter without… outside assistance.” Squeaks’ grief turned to desperation. “I… I’ll do anything. Please… don’t let him vanish. Don’t let him leave me.” It was Xaphan, the fire genasi necromancer, who answered the call. In a tavern lit by candlelight, Squeaks begged him to help. “Please,” she whispered, wrapping Wilson in her hands, “you have to keep him alive. He… he gave everything for me.” Xaphan studied the small rat, the faint glow of the child’s soul flickering beneath the fur. “A clever problem. Usually the unhinged don’t survive this long,” he said dryly. “I’m desperate,” Squeaks said, her voice breaking. “I don’t care what it takes.” With careful incantations, Xaphan stabilized the bond between Wilson and the soul of Squeaks’ child. The rat’s eyes glowed faintly, his ribs showing slight shimmer beneath fur, but he moved, alive, carrying both lives within him. “Congratulations,” Xaphan said. “You now have the world’s smallest revenant, with a soul twice burdened.” Squeaks scooped Wilson into her arms, tears streaking her dirt-smeared cheeks. “Thank you. Thank you… both of you.” “Don’t thank me yet,” Xaphan said, the corners of his lips twitching. “The living world rarely welcomes what’s stolen from the dead.” Now, Squeaks walks the world with Wilson on her shoulder. The bond between them is strange, fragile, and miraculous. She carries grief, but also determination. Her child’s life endures through Wilson, and though she cannot yet give him a human form, she searches tirelessly for a way to save both. Her companions’ memory, her lost child, and Wilson’s willing sacrifice shape her every step. Each dagger strike, each shadow she slips through, carries vengeance, survival, and hope intertwined. Squeaks is no longer simply a thief, a shadow, or a rogue. She is a mother, a protector, and a thief of impossible things—the living, the dead, and those in-between. And somewhere in the misty night, a little rat, glowing faintly with an otherworldly light, whispers that he will never leave her side, no matter what form he takes

## **EMBERS IN THE DARK**

The fire had burned down to a faint ring of coals, just enough to keep the cold at bay. Xaphan sat cross-legged beside it, the night air thick with mist and the scent of rain-soaked pine. His ember-colored hair had dimmed to a soft orange glow, casting ripples of light across the bone charms laid neatly beside him. He was halfway through a trance — that deep, meditative stillness where even the dead seemed to whisper softer — when something in the dark crunched. He sighed. “If that’s another ghoul, I swear to the Nine—” A small voice piped up: “Don’t blast me!” Xaphan froze. Slowly, he turned his head toward the sound. From behind a boulder stepped a small half-orc wrapped in a patched cloak, her braid frizzed by humidity and her eyes bright as coals in the firelight. Perched on her shoulder, Wilson chittered softly, the green glow in his eyes flickering. Squeaks raised both hands in mock surrender. “Told you not to blast me.” The genasi pinched the bridge of his nose. “Squeaks. It’s midnight. In the middle of nowhere.” “Yeah,” she said, shrugging as she stepped closer. “Found your camp. Wilson tracked you.” He glanced at the undead rat, unimpressed. “Of course he did. Tiny abomination probably smells my spell components.” Wilson squeaked indignantly. Squeaks grinned, dropping cross-legged across from him by the fire. “You’re hard to find, y’know. Thought you might’ve gone and gotten yourself killed again.” “Not for lack of opportunity,” Xaphan muttered, rearranging a few runes in the dirt. “I prefer solitude while I recover.” “Yeah, about that—” she interrupted, reaching into her satchel. “I brought you something.” He raised an eyebrow. “If it’s another dead animal, I’m leaving.” She laughed, the sound too bright for the hour. “Nah. Not this time.” With surprising care, she unwrapped a small bundle of dark cloth and held it out to him. Inside was a blackened rib bone, polished and etched with glowing runes that pulsed in soft violet light. The ends were capped with silver bands engraved with necromantic sigils. Xaphan’s eyes narrowed. “…Is that—?” “A Soulbinder’s focus,” she said proudly. “Lets you channel residual death magic without, y’know, frying your nerves. Found it in a crypt I definitely wasn’t supposed to be in.” He stared at her. “You robbed a crypt.” She shrugged. “I was bored. And you deserved a gift.” Xaphan picked up the artifact carefully. The runes flared brighter at his touch, responding to the heat of his elemental energy. “This is… not a trinket, Squeaks. Where exactly did you find this?” “Somewhere between a dead priest and a very offended ghost,” she said with a grin. “You’d have loved it.” He sighed, but his lips twitched in the faintest smile. “You’re out of your mind.” “Probably,” she said. “But it’s kind of my thing.” For a long moment, he just studied her across the fire — this tiny, half-feral thief who kept popping into his life like an inconvenient ghost herself. “You know,” he said finally, his voice low, “most people try to stay away from necromancers. You’re the only one who seems determined to bring me gifts.” Squeaks smiled faintly. “Most people never brought Wilson back.” That shut him up. She nudged the bone toward him. “Keep it. Maybe it’ll help you with your… fire corpse magic stuff.” He huffed, but his hand closed around it gently. “It’s called soulcrafting, you ungrateful gremlin.” “Sure it is,” she said, grinning as she lay back beside the fire, using her pack as a pillow. Wilson climbed from her shoulder to her chest, curling up like a warm, glowing stone. Xaphan shook his head, half amused, half resigned. “You’re staying, aren’t you?” “Just till morning,” she murmured, already halfway asleep. “Promise.” He sighed, staring into the coals. “You never keep promises.” “Maybe this one.” He looked at her — the soot on her cheek, the faint snore, the rat snuggled on her collarbone — and something in his chest flickered warmer than fire. “Fine,” he muttered. “But if you snore louder than the undead again, I’m exorcising you too.” Wilson squeaked in protest. Xaphan smirked. “Yes, you as well.” The night grew quiet again, save for the crackle of embers — two unlikely souls resting beneath a sky the color of ashes.
