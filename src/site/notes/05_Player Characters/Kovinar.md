**[Kovinar Relkth](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/84919060)** is a Tiefling born beneath the gilded banners of House Relkth, a noble family whose grandeur masked a rotting core. Generations ago, when their fortunes began to wane, the Relkths sought strength not from gods or honor, but from the [[Nine Hells\|Nine Hells]]. Their matriarch forged a pact with [[06_NPCs/Malphas\|Malphas]], the archdevil and general of [[Tiamat\|Tiamat]] when she still ruled [[Avernus\|Avernus]]. In exchange for wealth, military dominance, and influence, her bloodline was forever bound to Hell’s service. Thus, Kovinar was born with horns, ember-bright eyes, and the shadow of damnation upon his soul. 

From his first cries, infernal whispers wrapped around him, urging obedience to Malphas. His family viewed him as the key to their resurgence—a vessel of dark promise, destined to spread tyranny under the guise of noble duty. But Kovinar was different. Even as a boy, he recoiled from cruelty. When ordered to punish servants, he instead shielded them. When taught that strength was domination, he questioned whether strength could instead mean protection. For every whisper of Malphas, there was an ember of defiance. That ember dwindled while Kovinar encountered the Green Dragon Mask on a quest throughout Phandelver. Kovinars close proximity to the evil relic of Tiamat allowed Malphas' influence to grow stronger that it ever had before. 

With the intent to use its strength to fight evil, the Green Dragon Mask brought corruption and twisted Kovinar, nearly to his demise while fighting against the Cult of the Dragon. By grace and Kovinar's salvation, he was brought to the Temple of [[06_NPCs/Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]]. Through the power of the Platinum Dragon, Kovinar was separated from the Green Dragon Mask and freed from its corrupting influence, but the whisper of Malphas continued though their infernal bond. 

Lost, unguided, and cold within the holy ancient temple, Kovinar found a crumbling mural depicting Bahamut’s stand against Tiamat, light against shadow, mercy against tyranny. In that moment, Kovinar realized: if he was the child of a pact with Tiamat’s general, then he would dedicate his life to Tiamat’s eternal foe. Kneeling before the shattered altar, Kovinar swore himself to Bahamut. In that instant, the cold dwindling ember that once glowed within Kovinar ignited into an inferno with his soul. The divine light of the Platinum Dragon did not erase his infernal bond—but it gave him strength to wield it, rather than be ruled by it. 

Now a Paladin of Vengeance, Kovinar is relentless against the forces of tyranny and corruption. He serves Bahamut not only with blade and prayer, but also by turning the infernal gifts of Malphas against Hell itself. The eldritch power that should have enslaved him, he bends to his oath, using it to hunt fiends, dragons, and tyrants alike. 

Among the common folk, Kovinar is whispered of as the *Dragon’s Shadow*—a knight who wears the visage of Hell but fights for Heaven. Among devils, his name is spoken with rage, for he is a living insult: a child of Malphas who spits upon his patron’s designs. Yet deep within his heart, Kovinar knows this war will never end. The chains of his birth still rattle in the dark. Malphas watches, patient and amused, confident that even now Bahamut’s chosen will one day fall. But Kovinar refuses. For every battle he fights, every tyrant he casts down, and every soul he saves, he proves the truth of his oath: He was born of Hell, but he chooses Heaven. He is vengeance, but also justice. He is Kovinar Relkth, the eldritch paladin of Bahamut, shadow of the Dragon, and bane to the servants of tyranny.
