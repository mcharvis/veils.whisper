### 📍 Location

- **Ya’a Thalor**, outskirts of [[The Evergrowing Forest\|The Evergrowing Forest]]—formerly a Sanctifier stronghold turned psychic containment site.

### 💥 What Happened

- **Ogre zombies** crashed through the outer defenses at dusk.
    
- The Sanctifiers fought valiantly but were **unprepared**, especially with their forces thinned from internal tensions. 

### ⚔️ Outcome

- **Roughly one-third** of the stationed Sanctifiers were killed in the first hour. The [[Circle of Twelve\|Circle of Twelve]] reportedly killed themselves in a suicide pact.
    
- An elite unit fell back into the crypt levels, fighting room by room. Encountered zombies. 
- **[[Maelth\|Maelth]]**, a high-ranking Sanctifier, **panicked and deserted**, abandoned his post. He was later **captured by scouts from Jade Stronghold** while wandering in a daze near the southern road.
