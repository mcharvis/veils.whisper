### 📍 Location

- **Ya’a Thalor**, outskirts of [[The Evergrowing Forest\|The Evergrowing Forest]]—formerly a Sanctifier stronghold turned psychic containment site.

### 💥 What Happened

- A sudden incursion of undead from [[02_World/Ahrown, The Kingdom of Elves/Capital of Ahrown\|Capital of Ahrown]] breached [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]]’s perimeter.
    
- The undead—fast, coordinated, and strangely **intelligent**—were unlike anything the Sanctifiers had faced before. Some suspect a necromancer was involved. 
    
- **Ogre zombies**, flanked by waves of elven corpses in ceremonial garb, crashed through the outer defenses at dusk.
    
- The Sanctifiers fought valiantly but were **unprepared**, especially with their forces thinned from internal tensions. 

### ⚔️ Outcome

- **Roughly one-third** of the stationed Sanctifiers were killed in the first hour. The [[Circle of Twelve\|Circle of Twelve]] reportedly killed themselves in a suicide pact.
    
- An elite unit fell back into the crypt levels, fighting room by room. Encountered zombies. 
    
- A few fled into the forest.
    
- **[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Dronir Maelth\|Sanctifier Dronir Maelth]]**, a high-ranking Sanctifier, **panicked and deserted**, abandoned his post. He was later **captured by scouts from Jade Stronghold** while wandering in a daze near the southern road.

## 👤 Maelth's Current Role

- Now **imprisoned in the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]]**, not because of guilt, but because **[[06_NPCs/Councilor Varn Drest\|Councilor Varn Drest]]** (or another political figure) sees him as a valuable pawn:
    
    - **He knows the Sanctifiers’ secrets.**
        
    - **He was part of the [[Circle of Twelve\|Circle of Twelve]].**

- He’s treated more like a political detainee than a prisoner—locked in a guarded study, not a dungeon. His mind is fraying under the weight of guilt.

Known only by [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Dronir Maelth\|Sanctifier Dronir Maelth]] and other remaining sanctifiers
