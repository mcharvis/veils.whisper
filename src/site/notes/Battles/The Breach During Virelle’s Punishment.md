**Sanctifier Virelle**, stripped of rank and dignity, was being punished again for the birth of a child the Order deemed a blight. Her arms were bound to the table. Blood dripped from her nose where she’d already been struck. Three junior Sanctifiers stood around her, reciting doctrine aloud, each taking turns delivering cold, deliberate blows meant to break—not kill.

**Halric**, her former lover, never participated.

Then came the sound—soft at first, like wind through broken glass.

They emerged from the trees—**dozens of them**.  
Flesh pale and sunken. Eyes clouded with green haze.  
Not shambling. Not moaning.  
**Walking with purpose.**

The Sanctifiers left the chamber to meet the threat, blades drawn, scripture still on their lips.

But they never came back.

Virelle was left alone—**strapped to the table**, blood pooling beneath her, listening to the silence that followed.

And then the door creaked open. Standing before her...not Halric, but a massive ogre zombie.
