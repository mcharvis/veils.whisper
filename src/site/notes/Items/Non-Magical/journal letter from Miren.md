I don’t even know where you are, mama.

Some days I wonder if you were real at all, or just a dream I kept too long.

They keep saying I’m important…that I have to stay. But no one here smiles like you did. I miss being your dreamberry.

If you were here, maybe it wouldn’t feel so loud inside me. Maybe I could sleep. I don’t want to be strong, mama. 

I just want to come home.”
