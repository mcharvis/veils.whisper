[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier John Halric\|Halric]] agreed. 
He said no one would believe she left on her own. And to think that her mother is so close... 

There is no way we can infiltrate the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]]…yet. [[04_Organizations/The Sanctifiers\|Sanctifiers]] aren’t numerous enough. 

If we can get [[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|Velura]] before her daughter finds out, 
we can use our capture of [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren]] to demand an audience with [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]]. 

[[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]] may not listen to [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]] but her [[The Three Sisters\|sisters]] will.
