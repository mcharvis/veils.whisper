### **Scripture Tag (Twisted Doctrine Reference)**

> **“IV – 13”** = _Book 4, Verse 13_ from Sanctifier doctrine

From the Sanctifiers’ scripture or “The Flame Codex.” A made-up verse could read:

> _“Blessed are those who wear no face of their own, for they are clay in the fire’s hand.”_

This would frame the pendant as a tool of **total obedience and faceless faith**, tying the number to fanaticism.
