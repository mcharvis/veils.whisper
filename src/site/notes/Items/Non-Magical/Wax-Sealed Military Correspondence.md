**By hand of Ser Calvyn Roen, Scout-Captain of the Northern Watch**  
**To: Councilor Varn Drest, Fifth Seat of Oasis, Jade Stronghold**

My Lord,

In accordance with your directive, I send this dispatch under seal. The tomb of [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier John Halric\|Sanctifier John Halric]] in [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]] was opened by my order three nights past. What lay within was not man nor bone, but a shell of iron and wax, shaped to resemble a knight’s remains. There was no soulbound residue. No true death.

This burial was false.

Witnesses report movement in the Mithril Hills, along the 12th Mile, south of the Capital of Arhown. A rider cloaked in ash, bearing [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier John Halric\|Sanctifier John Halric]]’s crest, was seen crossing a ridge at dusk. His helm was unfastened. His face—pale, watching, unchanged by years.

The old patrol route from [[Yll'nor Dorei\|Yll'nor Dorei]] to [[On'en Dorei\|On'en Dorei]] has gone silent. Shelter posts are abandoned. One squire was found babbling and blind—he spoke Halric’s name seven times before biting his own tongue.

Carviings on nearby stone read: _“The living are not dismissed.”_

I advise no pursuit. If Halric walks, he does so with free command and full of purpose. Whether his following is loyal or bound, I cannot say.

Mark him accordingly:

> **Commander Halric – False Buried | Active Command | Unsworn**

By your leave,  
Ser Calvyn Roen  
Watch-Sigil 14, Northern Marches
