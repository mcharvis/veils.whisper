**To Commander Velexia,**

The rumors out of Arhown have shifted from troubling to actionable.  
The "Mad King" grows unstable, and we have received intelligence that he may be engaging in unauthorized pacts—possibly even Void-aligned. His fixation with preserving “the bloodline” has drawn the attention of Oasis.

You are hereby authorized to dispatch a team—independent of Sanctifier oversight—to **evaluate the risk and establish diplomatic leverage**.

Priority is to **secure passage through Arhown** and determine whether the King's instability can be controlled, cured… or replaced.

Councilor Drest has eyes on the region. Coordinate with him only if required.
