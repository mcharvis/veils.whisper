> My little Firefly,
> I hope this letter finds its way to you. This kind trader promised to leave it near where we last were.  If you’re reading this, you're alive…and that means there's still hope.
> They took me somewhere. I don’t know what they want with me. Maybe it’s because of what I can do…maybe for who I am. But they don’t know about you, and that may be the only reason you're free.

> This is very important: if you feel lost in the Evergrowing Forest, do not seek shelter amongst strangers; be careful with places that promise asylum…that promise to fix what they do not understand.  
> If someone else finds this letter… please find my daughter. 
> I love you, Dreamberry.
> 
> -Mama
