> 
> We tried to file for your release through the proper channels. There is **no record of your detainment**—no vote, no writ, not even a name in the archives.
> 
> You are being held outside the reach of Oasis law. That means someone powerful is hiding you... or hiding _from_ you.
> 
> I don't know if this letter will reach you.  
> But if it does: **hold on**. We haven’t given up. There are still those who remember you, who believe in what you are.
> 
> You are not forgotten.  You are not abandoned.
