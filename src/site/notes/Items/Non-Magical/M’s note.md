A torn scrap of journal paper found in the fire pit—crumpled and smudged, but still legible:

> “I waited until dark. No one came. I think Mama is gone. The trees won’t talk to me anymore.
> 
> There’s a house. Big, with lights. I saw other children. Maybe they’ll let me stay. Maybe I can sleep.”
> 
> — M.

There are faint tears on the paper, and a blot of mud where her small hand gripped it.
