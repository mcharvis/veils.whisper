[[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Headmistress]],

[[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|She]] arrived three winters past, found in our storage. Said nothing, not at first. Only stared. We thought her fragile, but the walls began to remember her.

When we freed her, the walls trembled, and something beneath the church stirred. She could prove helpful but she doesn’t trust us.
When we left her, she said nothing—but later, we dreamed of her voice, and one of us woke up weeping blood.
We are using her— she calms the [[06_NPCs/The Dreaming Mouth\|Mouth]], but we can tell she hates us and her mind is slipping away.

She doesn’t speak unless she’s alone. She doesn’t blink when she’s watched. The children’s toys rot faster near her. The beast became stronger when she arrived but remained contained. So, we were forced to keep her. But reality twists around her. Priests have gone … silent…one by one. Not dead—just… blank. As if someone turned off their minds and left the bodies behind. I couldn’t let them leave.

We thought she was haunted. Now I’m certain: she is the haunting. Whatever you buried in her… it isn’t dormant. You should have never let her leave.
