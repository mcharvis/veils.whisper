_Weapon (Greatsword), Very Rare, Requires Attunement_

This black-steel blade is etched with scenes of fallen soldiers and vanquished foes, each etched figure locked in eternal anguish. When swung, it emits a faint dirge-like hum.

#### Base Weapon Stats

- **Weapon Type:** Greatsword (martial melee weapon)
- **Damage:** 2d6 + 5 slashing
- **Properties:** Heavy, Two-Handed

#### Proficiency 

Proficiency with a Greatsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.

### **Optional Effects**

- **Necrotic Edge.** Deals an additional 1d8 + 4 necrotic damage on a hit.
    
- **Glory To Death.** You may choose to gain **advantage on all attacks with this sword** until the end of your current turn.
    
- **Nerullâ€™s Dividend.** Once per long rest, when you take damage that reduces you below half your hit points, you may immediately make one melee weapon attack as a reaction. If it hits, it deals an extra 2d8 necrotic damage and add that damage to your HP.
    

### Accounting
- **Ledger of the Fallen.** The blade records every soul it claims and every time its dark powers are invoked. The attuned wielder must personally **keep a tally of each kill made with the sword and every use of its optional abilities**. The DM may demand the count at any time.
