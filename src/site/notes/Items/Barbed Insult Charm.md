**Barbed Insult Charm**  
_Wondrous item, common (consumable)_

This small charm (a blackened coin stamped with a sneering face) carries a single, sharpened phrase that wants to be spoken.

**Use (1 charge):** As an action, you speak the insult and cast **_vicious mockery_**. The charm then crumbles to gray dust.

- **Spell save DC:** Uses your spell save DC. If you don’t have one, the DC is **13**.
    
- **Spellcasting ability:** Uses your spellcasting ability. If you don’t have one, treat it as **Charisma**.
    
- **Components:** Verbal only (you must be able to speak).
    
- **On a failed save:** The target takes **1d4 psychic damage** and has **disadvantage on the next attack roll** it makes before the end of its next turn.
