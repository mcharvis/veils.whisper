## 🔥 **Velvak’s Iron**

_Legendary weapon (mace), requires attunement by a creature with a Divine or Monastic background (e.g. monk, cleric, paladin)_

> _“It was not a symbol. It was not a lie. It was the will of the Flame, delivered by hand.”_

---

### 🛠 Appearance:

A heavy, two-handed mace with **no polish or craftsmanship**.  
Its iron head is **flat on one side**, **studded with coals on the other**, each coal **permanently burning without flame**.  
The haft is wrapped in **worn white cloth** stained with dried blood and ash.

When attuned, the weapon becomes **hot to the touch for everyone but the wielder.**  
It **leaves no burns—but it remembers every scar it gave.**

---

### 🩸 Lore:

[[06_NPCs/Velvak\|Velvak]] was a [[04_Organizations/Pale Flame\|Pale Flame]] monk, one of the **original artisans of ritual suffering**.  
He forged this weapon not for war—but to deliver judgment through **purified pain**.  
It was used in **ritualized punishment**, **martyrdom rites**, and **anointments by fire**.

Eventually, it was **sealed beneath [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Thornhold Keep\|Thornhold Keep]]** after [[06_NPCs/Velvak\|Velvak]] disappeared—whether consumed by the Flame or killed for going too far, no one knows.

### 🔥 Properties

#### 🔹 **+3 Mace**

- Counts as magical for overcoming resistance.
    
- Two-handed (unusual for a mace).
    

#### 🔹 **Purifying Blows** _(Passive)_

When you reduce a creature to 0 HP, you may choose to either:

- Leave their body **immaculate** (bloodless, flame-kissed, as if forgiven),
    
- Or **mark them forever**, burning your handprint into their corpse.
    

#### 🔹 **Cleansing Fire** _(2x/day)_

As a bonus action, you may invoke the Flame. Until the end of your turn:

- All attacks with this weapon deal **2d6 fire damage** in addition to normal damage.
    
- If you kill a creature during this time, all **divine casters** within 30 ft. must succeed a **DC 16 Wisdom saving throw** or be **unable to cast divine spells** until the end of their next turn.
    

#### 🔹 **Monastic Wrath** _(Only usable by Monks)_

When used with Martial Arts or Flurry of Blows:

- May replace any unarmed strike with a **strike from Velvak’s Iron**
    
- When you do, the blow **ignites your ki**: the target takes **1d6 radiant damage**, and the next saving throw they make before your next turn has **disadvantage**
    

#### 🔹 **Final Rite** _(1x/long rest)_

As an action, you may **kneel, raise Velvak’s Iron, and declare judgment**. All creatures of your choice within 15 ft. must make a **DC 17 Constitution saving throw** or be **knocked prone**, take **6d6 fire damage**, and be **unable to speak or cast spells with verbal components** for 1 minute.  
Targets who succeed take half damage and are not silenced.  
This ability cannot be used again until the wielder has taken a **long rest on sacred ground or in a place of great suffering**.

### 🕊️ Seren’s Belief:

> “It was never just a weapon. It was the voice of fire when the gods went quiet.  
> Not because it was righteous—but because it was _louder._”

She won’t use it—but she **reveres it**.  
If given to her, she may **lead a rite**, **ignite an entire hall**, or even **sacrifice herself** to unleash its final legacy.
