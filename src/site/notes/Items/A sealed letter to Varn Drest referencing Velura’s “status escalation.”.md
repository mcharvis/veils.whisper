Councilor Drest,

Per your instructions, I write to confirm that **the matter of Velura has entered a state of escalation**. Though her confinement remains secure, there are complications beyond the walls of the Stronghold that require your immediate counsel. Certain voices in the Civil Assembly press for clarification, while others grow restless at her suspected detainment.

Commander Velexia has voiced her concerns, though she remains dutiful. I caution that silence or delay in your response may only sharpen the fractures already present.

The next waning of the moon will not wait. We have days at best. I urge you to issue direction before then.

In loyal service,

_â€”Scribe Althren, on behalf of the_ _Civil Assembly of Oasis_
