_Weapon (longsword), rare (requires attunement)_

This wicked, forked longsword was not forged in light—but in fury.  
Crafted by exiled vampire hunters from Oasis who saw **the gods do nothing**, _Ashrend_ was meant not to protect, but to **punish**. Its jagged blade gleams like scorched iron, and the fuller is etched with names—each one carved in by a dying hand.
