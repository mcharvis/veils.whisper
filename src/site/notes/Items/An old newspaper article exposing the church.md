**Psychic Church Ya’a Thalor Concealed More Than Pain—It Bred It**

_By Elvira Mordane, Special Correspondent_

Deep within the Evergrowing Forest lies the decaying husk of what was once **Ya’a Thalor**, a revered sanctuary of the Sanctifiers—a sect of psychic priests whose doctrines shaped the region’s early mentalist traditions. But recent findings suggest the church’s history is not one of salvation... but of sublimation, suppression, and something far more disturbing.

The Sanctifiers believed that **emotion was a parasite** and **memory a wound**, festering within the mind like rot in a tree. Their solution? A psychic ritual known as the **Mind-Chain**—a binding process that extracted guilt, trauma, and madness from willing subjects. However, such thoughts could not be banished to air or ash. They required a host medium. Records recovered from the outer crypt indicate that these memories were suspended in **bodily fluids**: blood, sweat, tears, saliva, mucus, bile, even urine.

Though well-intentioned by design, the practice had an unforeseen consequence.

> “They never meant to bury evil,” says one anonymous source familiar with Sanctifier rites. “But you can only pile grief into a cellar so long before it begins to breathe.”

Beneath Ya’a Thalor, in what is now referred to by survivors and scholars as the **Root-Level**, these bound memories began to coalesce—not into silence, but into sentience. The result is a psychic amalgam known as **The Dreaming Mouth**: a writhing, incorporeal mass of broken thoughts and emotional refuse. It feeds on memory. It echoes with guilt. It dreams... but not its own dreams.

The church was never meant to be a prison. But through the Sanctifiers' desire to _protect the mind_, they created something that preys upon it.

The doors of Ya’a Thalor remain sealed, though whispers claim some still enter... and not all return.
