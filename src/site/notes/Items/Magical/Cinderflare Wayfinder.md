### **Description**

A broad band of braided gold alloy and smelted volcanic glass, resembling swirling magma with an inner ember glow. When held close, the ring emits a soft crackling sound and radiates a shifting warmth, as if alive. Its interior is lined with a fine strip of blackened coral—always warm, never harmful.

### **Usage**

**1/long rest** – The wearer may use the following two abilities:

- **Inscribe Waypoint (Action):** Mark your current location as a teleportation waypoint.
- **Teleport (Action):** Instantly return to the inscribed waypoint from any distance on the same plane.

### **Lore**

Legends of the Cinderflare Wayfinder have mostly been lost to time. A scorched page in a ruined chronicle claims fire genasi artisans forged the ring using the final breath of a phoenix. Other texts suggest rebel mages used it to escape collapsing planar portals during the [[Siege of the Ember Gate\|Siege of the Ember Gate]].

By the time scholars recovered its name, its trail had already grown cold. The ring’s current whereabouts are thought to be unknown. However, it is currently in the possession of [[05_Player Characters/Verspertina Galanodel\|Verspertina Galanodel]]

### **Material Composition**

Common gold alloy, volcanic glass, and blackened coral.
