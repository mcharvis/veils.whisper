_Wondrous Item (Pen), Uncommon (requires attunement)_

---

### **Description**

This ornate fountain pen has a nib made of blackened silver and a body filled with deep crimson ink that seems to **pulse** when held. The ink never runs out—because it refills with blood.  
Not yours. Not always.

The pen writes in a deep red ink that **glistens unnaturally** and remains **legible even in complete darkness.**

---

### **Living Ink**

While attuned to the pen, you gain the following abilities:

#### **Spellcasting**

You can cast the **Command** spell (save DC 13) once per long rest.

- To do so, you must write the command as a **single word** on a surface visible to the target (e.g., paper, a wall, even the air).
    
- The word **glows briefly** and then vanishes as the spell takes effect.
    

#### **Blood Oath**

If the pen is used to **sign a contract or name**, the target must succeed on a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw** or feel **compelled to honor their promise** for the next **24 hours** (_DM's discretion_).  
This effect has **no mechanical enforcement**—but it can be binding in the mind or spirit.
