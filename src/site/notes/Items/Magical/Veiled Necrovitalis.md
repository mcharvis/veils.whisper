Once the heartstone of an ancient Staff of Necromancy, the Veiled Necrovitalis is a polished purple gem about the size of one's palm, smooth to the touch yet unnervingly cold. Veins of violet swirl within, moving ever so slightlyâ€”like tendrils searching for a soul. When held, it reflects no light, only shadow, and in complete silence, it hums like a memory trying to surface.
