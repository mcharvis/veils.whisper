### 📿 **Item Description**

A small, flame-shaped **iron pendant** on a worn black cord.  Etched with jagged **Sanctifier runes**, sharp and asymmetrical—cut too deep, as if burned in rather than carved. The back is marked with **“[[Items/Non-Magical/IV – 13\|IV – 13]]”** and the phrase: > _“Blessed are those who wear no face of their own, for they are clay in the fire’s hand.”_

When held, it faintly hums with warmth. When worn, it shimmers briefly—and then reality adjusts.

### ✨ **Effect (When Worn)**

###### The wearer is immediately cloaked in the **visual likeness of a Sanctifier acolyte**.

- Clothes, face, and posture shift to match a uniformed Sanctifier in ceremonial armor
- This is an **illusory transformation only**—no abilities or credentials are granted

🛡️ _Mechanically, this functions as a constant_ **Disguise Self** _spell (no concentration, no action required), but it can’t be deactivated without removing the pendant._
