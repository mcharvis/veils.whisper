### 🟩 **Description**

A sleek ring of dark jade, cool to the touch, set in a thin band of brushed silver.  
Etched on the face is the **official seal of Oasis** 

---

### 🛡️ **Function**

The Jade Signet Ring is not magical—but in the Stronghold and Oasis society, it may as well be. It is a **political key**, recognized by enchantments, guards, and bureaucrats.

#### 🔓 **Effects in the Jade Stronghold**

- **Bypasses magical wards** at the **B3 stair on Floor 4**, allowing access to **Councilor Varn Drest’s office** on Floor 5 without triggering alarms.
- Can be shown to bypass non-magical security or bureaucracy in any Oasis-controlled area.
- If used with forged documents, grants **Advantage on Deception checks** in Oasis courts or embassies.

---

### ⚠️ **Risks**

- **Wearing it openly in front of Velexia or Councilor Varn Drest** without explanation may result in interrogation—especially if the wearer doesn’t belong to the Oasis chain of command.
- **If lost and later found**, it may be **traced back to the guest suite**, raising suspicion of theft or impersonation.
- Presenting the ring in the wrong context (e.g. to a Sanctifier agent) could provoke hostility or betrayal.

### 🧠 Lore (History DC 14)

- These rings are issued only to **ranked ambassadors**, **judicial envoys**, or **covert Oasis inspectors**. Owning one without documentation is a serious offense.
- Rumor says some signet rings are linked to **vaults** or **dead drops** throughout Oasis territory.
