*Wondrous Item, rare*
This ragged bear is threadbare and stained with something darker than dust. Its single eye glows faintly in moonlight. It once belonged to a child who dreamed too deeply. The bear remembers what she tried to forget.

**Soothing Memory.** As an action, you may clutch the bear and cast **[Lesser Restoration](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/2619016-lesser-restoration)** once per long rest.

**Muffled Presence.** While holding the bear, you may use a bonus action to become (invisible to creatures with truesight) until the start of your next turn. You must finish a long rest before using this feature again.

**Weep for the Forgotten (1/day).** You may cast Phantasmal Killer (DC 15) by whispering a memory into the bear’s ear. The spell manifests as a child's voice describing the target’s worst hidden fear.

### Phantasmal Killer
*4th Level Illusion*

| Casting Time: | Range:   | Target:                             | Duration:      |
| ------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1 action      | 120 feet | A creature you can see within range | Up to 1 minute |

You tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range and create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 15). On a failed save, the target becomes frightened for the duration. At the end of each of the target’s turns before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. 

On a successful save, the spell ends.
