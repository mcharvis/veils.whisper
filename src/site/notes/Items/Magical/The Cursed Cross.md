**Wondrous Item** (Necklace, requires attunement by a Paladin or Warlock), Rare  
**Unique Artifact**

## Lore

Forged by *[[Caelrith\|Caelrith]]*, a devoted loyalist of Xaphan, the Cursed Cross was once intended as a soul-harvesting relicâ€”meant to claim the dead for Nerull.

Though Xaphan could have wielded it to call upon Nerull and amass divine favor, his chaotic good nature refused the bond. The Cursed Cross remained untouched, dormant.

Before his fall, Xaphan entrusted the relic to ****[[05_Player Characters/Kovinar Relkth\|Kovinar Relkth]]**, a paladin devoted to Bahamut. In the sealed realm of **Elarith**, Kovinar now has a chance to attune it to *[[06_NPCs/Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]]*, turning a relic of damnation into a weapon of salvation.
