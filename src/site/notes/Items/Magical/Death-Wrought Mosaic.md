_“Fate rolls, but death chooses.”_

The Death-Wrought Mosaic is a set of **four six-sided dice**, each carved from obsidian. While most faces are etched with **numerals (2 through 5)**, the **1 and 6 faces bear no number.** Instead, they feature **forbidden sigils** resembling celestial alignment.

When the Mosaic is cast, the dice shimmer faintly—revealing ghostly reflections not your own. There are benefits and detriments to every roll. It is said that the role {roll} of fate's dice is to also cast shadows upon your path.

This relic is a compass - not one that points to a specific location, but one that reveals the way to it's sisters.  

Currently in the possession of [[05_Player Characters/Lurtza (Squeaks)\|Lurtza (Squeaks)]]

**Oracle:** "Oh, you seek the guidance of the Death-Wrought Mosaic, hoping it may illuminate your way. Tread carefully, as the role/roll of fate's dice is to also cast shadows upon your path."
"Yes, yes, I see them. Four in total, but … one in your grasp. Where are its sisters? Ah, with the sisters, yes, Tisiphone, Hecate, and Nyx. Together, they make the Death-Wrought mosaic.  But they can only guide you to The Veil. To speak with it…through it…you need more guidance than Xaphan can provide. That wizard is more chaos than cunning. You would do well to…stay in touch.”
