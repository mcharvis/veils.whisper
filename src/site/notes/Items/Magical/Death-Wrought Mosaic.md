_“Fate rolls, but death chooses.”_

The Death-Wrought Mosaic is a set of **four six-sided dice**, each carved from obsidian. While most faces are etched with **numerals (2 through 5)**, the **1 and 6 faces bear no number.** Instead, they feature **forbidden sigils** resembling celestial alignment.

This relic is a compass - not one that points to a specific location, but one that reveals the way to it's sisters.
