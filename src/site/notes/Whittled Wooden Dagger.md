### ðŸª“ **Whittled Wooden Dagger** _(Mundane Weapon â€“ Improvised, but lethal in the right hands)_

> At first glance, itâ€™s a childâ€™s toyâ€”a crude dagger carved from dark, splintered wood. The edge is chipped, uneven, and stained with something long dried. The hilt is wrapped in faded red thread. Despite its construction, it fits perfectly in a small handâ€¦ or a rogueâ€™s grip.
