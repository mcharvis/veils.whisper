> **Given by**: _The Sanctum of the Withered Light_  
> **Objective**: Infiltrate _Thornhold Keep_ to recover a sealed reliquary from its underground archives  
> **Secret Purpose**: To erase the legacy of a Sanctifier commander who defected during the fall of **Ya’a Thalor**


> Dr. Brenden Gongol
> “Your loyalty to Drest is noted, Kovinar. The smoke has shifted and Drest requires your assistance. There is a task we place upon you and your companions. (a lie) A cursed item, once wielded by a heretic knight, lies buried beneath Thornhold Keep. The thing is a reliquary of shame — a scar Oasis dares not wear. It must never see the light again. You will quietly find it. You will deliver it to us. And you will ensure that it never harms Oasis again. If you are caught...well, don't get caught.”

### 🧨 The Hidden History:

- Long ago, during the early experiments in **Ya’a Thalor**, a Sanctifier commander named **[[06_NPCs/Maevryn Tol\|Maevryn Tol]]** **broke rank** after witnessing what was being done in the crypt levels—namely, the use of innocents emotions and memories for potions.
    
- Tol fled Oasis with a **sealed reliquary**—not of magical power, but of damning truth: **his  [[Items/Velvak's Iron\|oathblade]], his personal journal, and a runed map** leading to hidden lower levels of Ya’a Thalor the public has never seen.
    
- He surrendered it to the Oasis council for safekeeping… but they locked it away, afraid of what it could expose.

### 🔥 Seren’s Role:
- She arrives at Thornhold Keep _after_ the party has already been hired by the Sanctum of the Withered Light for the same job. She warns them they’ve been lied to (if they aren't already aware of that) and that if they destroy the reliquary, they’ll be complicit in covering up atrocities.
