[[06_NPCs/Councilor Varn Drest\|Councilor Varn Drest]]: "Some in the Civil Assembly complain of my tactics here. Curious, isn’t it, that the loudest voice belongs to Liora? Opposition often hides fear—fear of what I might uncover. Tell me, should I be watching her… or watching you?"

“Would you be willing to deliver a message to Thornhold Keep on my behalf? It spares me the tedium of couriers.” 

### Quest Frame

**Surface Goal:** Deliver [[Drest’s letter\|Drest’s letter]] to Thornhold Keep. On paper, it’s a minor courier job.
