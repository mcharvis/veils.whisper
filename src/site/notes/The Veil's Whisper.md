## üîÆ Words from an Oracle
> These are whispers and visions that have emerged but may not yet be understood.

- **Where is Xaphan?** "The place where Xaphan is held exists beyond the Veil."
- **What is your purpose?** "In this realm, I am neither alive...nor dead. I am neither here nor there. I observe, I guide, but the prophecy you‚Äôre fulfilling was forged long ago by hands more skilled than mine."
- **What is the Veil?** ‚ÄúThe Veil is not a wall, adventurer...It is a boundary of unmaking. A skin stretched thin between what was, what is, and what was never meant to be. It keeps the dead quiet. It keeps the gods blind. It keeps the world sane.‚Äù
- **Do you know Xaphan?** "Xaphan tempted me with promises and dreams, of a time when paths would converge under a banner of grace. But centuries have passed and I‚Äôve grown to believe that such things are whispers from the wind...and not beyond the veil."
- **What is the Death-Wrought Mosaic?** "Oh, you seek the guidance of the Death-Wrought Mosaic, hoping it may illuminate your way. Tread carefully, as the role/roll of fate's dice is to *also* cast shadows upon your path. Yes, yes, I see them. Four in total, but ‚Ä¶ one in your grasp. Where are its sisters? Ah, with the sisters, yes, Tisiphone, Hecate, and Nyx. Together, they make the Death-Wrought mosaic.  But they can only guide you *to* The Veil. To speak with it‚Ä¶through it‚Ä¶you need more guidance than Xaphan can provide. That wizard is more chaos than cunning. You would do well to‚Ä¶stay in touch.‚Äù
- **Advice about Elarith?** "Hear my words: not all that seeks to harm you is your enemy, and not all who offer aid are your friends. This place has mystery all around you. See with your *mind*, as well as your eyes. Use wisdom and be intentional. Look for details‚Ä¶*the little things*. Look at the forest **AND** the trees.‚Äù
- **What can the [[Items/Magical/Veiled Necrovitalis\|Veiled Necrovitalis]] do?** "The [[Items/Magical/Veiled Necrovitalis\|Veiled Necrovitalis]] is a powerful artifact that allows one to perform necromancy. If careless, it could sway the mind to focus on the dead...and undead. It could eventually be used to command armies of undead...if left to it's own destiny."
- **Advice?** "Be strategic about when to be bold, remember one's strengths & weaknesses."
