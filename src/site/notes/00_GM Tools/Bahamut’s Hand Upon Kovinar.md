_The Dragon God’s Quiet Patronage_

### Backstory

Bahamut has always despised Malphas’ philosophy of false safety. Where Malphas builds walls only to betray them, Bahamut embodies oaths that hold, justice that endures, and protection that does not fail.

Kovinar’s infernal bloodline made him an unlikely candidate for Bahamut’s blessing — tainted by Malphas’ schemes, born into a house that bartered with Hell. Yet, in his defiance of cruelty and betrayal, Bahamut saw what mortals rarely offer: resistance to their own worst nature.

The bond began subtly. At first, it was not a voice, but a presence — the weight of a watchful eye when Kovinar raised his shield, the shimmer of platinum light at his lowest ebb. Only when Malphas’ influence began to close its talons on the world did Bahamut make himself known, lending Kovinar the power to _stand when walls fall, to protect when all else betrays._

In Bahamut’s view, Kovinar is not a knight polished to perfection — he is a broken blade reforged. And broken blades, once reforged, cut truest.
