> _In Elarith, everything is already dead or dying. To die here is not to end, but to awaken in a place that knows your soul does not belong. There is no “death”—only the Trial._

#### 🌑 **Death is...encouraged

- When a PC’s HP drops to 0, they **do not fall unconscious**.
- Instead, they enter a **state of Dissonance**—they become **corporeally detached**, semi-ethereal, able to see and hear but **unable to affect the material world**.
- Healing **does not work** while in Dissonance. Their soul is being judged.

#### 🩸 **The Trial Begins**

- The creature's soul is pulled into **Nerull’s Trial**—a metaphysical, one-on-one encounter. Combat will pause for the trial. After combat, you will return to life as if no time has passed...but you will be different in some way until your next death.
