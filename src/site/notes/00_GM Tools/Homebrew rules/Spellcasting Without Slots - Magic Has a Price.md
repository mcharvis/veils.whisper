_In Elarith, magic obeys will, not mercy. You may tear it from the Veil—but it will tear something back._

### 📜 **New Rule: Overcasting**

A spellcaster may choose to **cast a spell without using a spell slot**, but doing so comes at a **dire personal cost**.

#### ⚠️ **The Cost**

- The caster immediately gains **levels of Exhaustion equal to the level of the spell cast**.
- Exhaustion gained this way **cannot be removed magically** (e.g., _Greater Restoration_).
- Only **a full long rest in a proper bed** can reduce this exhaustion (or via rare relics of the Veil).

> _Example: A wizard with no 3rd-level slots casts_ _Fireball__. They suffer **3 levels of Exhaustion** immediately._

---

### ✋ **Restrictions**

- You may not cast a spell **above your maximum spell level** known or prepared.
- You may only do this **once per long rest**, unless you have a feature or relic that permits more.

---

### 🧠 Why Use This?

- Enables **last-resort heroism**
- Adds **grit and consequence** to magic
- Reinforces the idea that in Elarith, even power is **dying and borrowed**
