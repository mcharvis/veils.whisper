_In Elarith, violence moves like a whisper through bone and soul. Death doesnâ€™t stop when the blade landsâ€”it carries forward._

When a player'sÂ **total damage exceeds the targetâ€™s remaining HP**, anyÂ **leftover damage (remainder)**Â can be applied to anotherÂ **enemy within reasonable reach or range**, atÂ **DM discretion**.

### âž•Â **Chain Effect**

- If theÂ **second target**Â is also killed andÂ **damage still remains**, the player may attempt to chain the damage again.
- To do so, they must succeed on anÂ **appropriate skill check (DC 15)**:
    - **STR (Athletics)**Â for melee brutes
    - **DEX (Acrobatics or Sleight of Hand)**Â for agile assassins
    - **INT (Arcana)**Â for magical chain reactions
    - Other checks allowed with DM approval

> _Example: A rogue stabs with a short sword on a Natural 20, dealing 21 damage to a 9 HP enemy. 12 damage remains. A nearby cultist is 5 feet awayâ€”DM allows the hit. Cultist has 8 HPâ€”killed. 4 HP remains. Rogue rolls DEX (Sleight of Hand) to redirect the blade into a third foe. Rolls 17 â†’ hit allowed._

### ðŸ”—Â **Limitations**

- Follow-up kills must beÂ **physically or narratively plausible**.
- A single skill check is required forÂ **each redirection**Â beyond the first
- Overflow damageÂ **cannot be saved or banked**Â for later use.
