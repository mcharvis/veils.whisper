_In Elarith, help arrives not with fanfare, but with silence. They do not lead. They follow. And they are disposable._

---

### 🎭 **What Are DMPCs or Mobs?**

- These are **covertly placed NPCs** created by the DM to offer **support**, fill **party gaps**, or provide **narrative tools**.
- They can be **converted into Allies** when the party needs them—mechanically, narratively, or emotionally.

---

### ⚖️ **Rules of Engagement**

#### 🧠 **1. Player-Controlled Priority**

- The **party has first right of control** over any DMPC or Mob.
- The DM will only step in for narration, combat mechanics, or flavor **if asked**.

#### 🤝 **2. Always Allies**

- DMPCs are **non-hostile to the party** and **exist only to support** the party.
- They never dominate scenes or override party choices.

#### 🗺️ **3. No Narrative Control**

- DMPCs **do not influence** where the campaign goes.
- They cannot make decisions **unless explicitly asked** by the party.
- The DM may answer on their behalf, but only in response to party inquiry.

#### ☠️ **4. No Killing Blows**

- A DMPC **can deal damage**, support, or aid in combat.
- However, they **cannot land killing blows**—**final strikes are reserved** for the party.

#### 🗡️ **5. Disposable by Design**

- **Any player** may dismiss, dispatch, or kill a DMPC at **any time**, with or without cause.
- No rolls, no resistance. DMPCs **accept their fate** without hesitation.

#### 🚶 **6. Followers, Not Leaders**

- These NPCs **follow the party’s will** at all times.
- They do not initiate plans, dominate social scenes, or act autonomously.
- They may provide **minor passive input** if asked directly.
