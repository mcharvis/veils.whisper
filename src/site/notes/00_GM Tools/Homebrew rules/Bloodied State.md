_In a land where everything is already dying, it's obvious when something starts to fall apart._

### ğŸ”»Â **Trigger**

- When a creature'sÂ **current hit points fall to 50% or less**, it becomesÂ **Bloodied**.
- TheÂ **party is immediately informed**â€”either through narration or a clear in-game visual cue. 
---

### ğŸ§ Â **Why It Matters**

- Encourages tactical planning (e.g. focus fire, conserve resources, finishers).
- Reinforces the gritty, decaying theme of Elarithâ€”_you know when something is failing_.

---

### ğŸ“£ DM Guidelines

- DeclareÂ **when**Â a creature becomes Bloodied, not the exact HP number.
