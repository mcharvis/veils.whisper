- When the GM calls for it, the player rolls **two d20s.**
- Take the result **farthest from 10** (the most extreme number).
- On a tie (like 5 and 15), reroll until there’s a clear result.
- Add modifiers as normal.
- The mechanic pushes results toward spectacular success or devastating failure — no middle ground.
