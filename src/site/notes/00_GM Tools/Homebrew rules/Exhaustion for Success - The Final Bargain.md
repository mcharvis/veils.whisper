### 🔥 **Rule: Exhaust Yourself for Success**

If a player **fails a saving throw**, they may choose to **automatically succeed** instead—by taking on **2 levels of Exhaustion**.

---

### ⚠️ **Key Mechanics**

- Must be declared **immediately after the failed save**, before knowing the full consequences.
    
- This may be used even if the character is at **Exhaustion Level 4.
	- Doing so pushes the character to **Exhaustion Level 6**, which would normally mean death. 
	- When a character uses this ability to survive at **Level 6 Exhaustion**, they do not die outright. Instead, they **immediately vanish from the battlefield**, pulled into **Nerull’s Trial** (as per your metaphysical death mechanic).
	They are gone. But not yet dead. The Veil must decide.

---

### 🔮 **What Happens Next**

- The player must **undergo Nerull’s Trial**, alone.

---

### 🧠 **Why This Works**

- Adds a **high-stakes gamble** to every fight.
- Makes **Exhaustion a resource**, not just a penalty.
- Reinforces the **world’s brutal metaphysics**, where defying death is possible—but never free.
