If a PC’s initiative comes **immediately after another PC**, they may choose to **combine their turns** into a single “epic action.”
- To do this, both players describe how their actions combine — a shared strike, spell + weapon, or tag-team maneuver.
- **Requirement:**
    - The action must be epic, cinematic, and make sense in-world.
    - It must aim for a **notable or finishing blow.**
- **Effect:**
    - Both players roll as normal for their actions, but the DM treats it as one unified strike.
    - If damage is enough to kill an enemy, narrate it as a spectacular death scene.
    - If not, the combined attack still inflicts **advantage on the next ally to strike that enemy.**
- **Cost:**
    - Both players forfeit their bonus actions that round (all effort poured into the combo).
