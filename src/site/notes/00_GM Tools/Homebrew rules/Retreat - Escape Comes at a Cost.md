### 🛑 **New Rule: Tactical Retreat**

Adventurers may **choose to retreat** from combat or encounters at any time, but doing so triggers **lasting consequences**.

#### ⚠️ **Retreat Conditions**

- At least one party member must use their **Action** to signal or initiate the retreat.
- All retreating party members must **move out of enemy threat range** (or take the consequences below).
- Once declared, retreat cannot be reversed—**the encounter ends**.

### 💀 **Consequences of Retreat**

Retreating from battle or key encounters results in **one or more of the following**, determined by the DM based on context:

| Situation             | Possible Consequences                                            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Combat retreat        | Enemies reposition, fortify, or become more aggressive.          |
| Story-critical moment | You lose trust with allies or fail time-sensitive goals.         |
| Open world            | Enemies may pursue or leave traps behind.                        |
| Boss/unique foe       | The foe grows stronger, learns your tactics, or becomes enraged. |

> _Example: Fleeing from a corrupted Sanctifier may cause it to evolve, stalk the party across the map, or execute hostages._

### 🎯 Design Notes

- Encourages **player agency** and **strategic decisions** without punishing survival.
- Keeps tension high in _Elarith_, where **running is not free**—but sometimes necessary.
