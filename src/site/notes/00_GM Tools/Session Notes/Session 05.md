# The Black Crow Ascends

**Date:** 09/12/2025
**Location:** Tristan's House  
**DM:** Mike
**Players Present:** Ryan, Tristan, Christine, Jesus, Mike Charvis, Mike Crump 

## Introduction

>‚ÄúPrepare to die.‚Äù
> 
> The words still ring in your ears from the battlefield. The last hours have been carved into memory: the sudden descent of necromancers claiming the dead for their own. You stood your ground there, fought back sorcery and shadows, and won‚Äînot only their lives, but rare weapons and secrets. From there Oasis awaited, with [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Thornhold Keep\|Thornhold Keep]], its politics, and the quiet rot of Drest and the [[04_Organizations/Pale Flame\|Pale Flame]].
> 
> But the forest had darker gifts still. In the graveyard of [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Chapel of Vex Ceniza\|Chapel of Vex Ceniza]], scarlet feathers scattered like embers, and the truth came screaming down from the sky.
> 
>  Hundreds of scarlet ravens blackened the skies, and with them - [[06_NPCs/Malis Fiani, The Scarlet Raven\|The Scarlet Raven]]. A name that can be shattered into another: **[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]].**
> 
> The whisper in Squeaks' ear‚Äî‚Äúsay goodbye‚Äù‚Äîwas no boast. It was final. Lifelessness injected into her spine by two sharp thrusts of scarlet steel followed by an arrow targeting Vespertina. Squeaks blood soaked the soil, and for a moment, there was nothing left but silence.
> 
> But silence is not the end.
> 
> Squeaks made an unexpected visit into [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]]‚Äôs hall, where death itself bends the knee to no one. There she was measured and scarred before being pulled back to Elarith as The Scarlet Raven vanished into the sky.
> 
> Now Oasis holds its breath. [[06_NPCs/Commander Velexia\|Commander Velexia]] carries secrets in her heart. Drest sharpens knives in shadows. [[04_Organizations/The Pale Flame\|The Pale Flame]] grows bold. And you walk on, knowing that another of your own has touched the god of death and returned.
> 
> Prepare yourselves. The war beneath the surface has only just begun.
> 
> Prepare to die.

### Oracle's Visit
> ‚ÄúYes, yes, messy business, dying. You went out on a good line, though. Not many get that luxury. ‚ÄòSay goodbye‚Äô‚Äîha! Some people just croak like startled geese.‚Äù
> 
> ‚ÄúNow you‚Äôve seen the curtain. Don‚Äôt waste your death. You only get so many before Nerull...well, let's just say you don't want him noticing you. So be wise.‚Äù
> 
> ‚ÄúYou wonder why I can wander about, whispering prophecies, without Nerull lifting me off my feet? Simple. I exist in Elarith with no heart. He can‚Äôt see me because I am neither alive nor dead. But don‚Äôt mistake the parts for the whole. The mind, the heart, the soul‚Äîthose are the strings the puppetmaster tugs to make you dance. They‚Äôre threads of the same rope: 
> 
> ‚ÄúThe heart-strings are the easiest. Pull them, and you dance for love, for fear, for longing. The soul-thread runs deeper‚Äîlike the puppet‚Äôs spine. It‚Äôs what keeps you standing at all, what binds you to the stage. And the mind-chains‚Ä¶ah, that‚Äôs the cruel one. It jerks your head where he wants it, makes you think his thoughts.‚Äù 
> 
> ‚ÄúStill‚Ä¶there are moments I‚Äôd give anything to feel it again. A flutter in the ribs, a rush of blood when his hand brushes yours, the ache when you miss someone. To weep because it matters. To break because it mattered. That‚Äôs what a heart gives you. And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve lost. I will have one someday.‚Äù


## Summary

> At the Threaded Hollow, Renzo offered a piece of himself. He confessed his past as a mercenary, but the [[06_NPCs/Verrath Dymane\|Verrath Dymane]] demanded more than words. He surrendered a memory, a secret he had carried alone: the moment of his own death. His fear lingered in the air, heavy and unshakable‚Äîhe admitted that what would one day kill him was not blade or spell, but the cost of doing the right thing‚Ä¶ and doing it wrong.
> 
> From there, the party pressed on to the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Chapel of Vex Ceniza\|Chapel of Vex Ceniza]]. A roll of the [[Items/Magical/Death-Wrought Mosaic\|Death-Wrought Mosaic]] summoned forth a Withermaid. The creature clawed its way into reality, but before it could take hold, Varian used Ashren to cut it down in a swift, brutal execution.
> 
> The road carried them next to the Ebon Reserve, where whispers of a missing relic found them. A quest was revealed: recover the stolen ledger seal from [[06_NPCs/Veyra, the Ashmonger\|Veyra, the Ashmonger]]. Their path wound onward into the [[Sanctum of Withered Light\|Sanctum of Withered Light]], where they met Dr. Brenden Gongol, a scholar who seemed to know more than he let on. He charged them with a task to infiltrate [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Thornhold Keep\|Thornhold Keep]] to recover a sealed reliquary from its underground archives.  
> 
> At Burdened Ox Transport, arrangements were made for the long passage to Ahrown, but the party stopped at [[Mithril Hills\|Mithril Hills]]. Yet rest was short-lived. Horror waited along the journey.
> 
> A woman knelt nearby, her face bulging as though something pressed beneath her skin, infecting the party with waves of paranoia. Renzo and Varian‚Äôs mouths filled with blood that poured unchecked, gagging and silencing them. An overturned wheelbarrow rattled with unseen movement. Dozens of corpses hung upside down from hooks, their cold hands brushed lovingly across their faces and deepening the creeping dread. A wall of darkness followed at their backs, closing in like a suffocating tide.
> 
> Varian suplexed guards from shadow. Among the wreckage, the party stole pickaxes from commoners and discovered [[Bloodfire Shards\|Bloodfire Shards]], pulsing with a malignant glow.
> 
> Then came the clash with the Sanctifiers. Steel met steel, until the leader revealed himself‚Äî[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier John Halric\|Sanctifier John Halric]]. A familiar rune burned into the ground before him. Halric proclaimed "It's too late!" Kovinar knew it at once. Halric had summoned [[06_NPCs/Malphas\|Malphas]].
> 
> Desperate and enraged, Kovinar attempted to redeem him with Divine Salvation, but Halric resisted. Kovinar hurled him over the ledge, where Lucian engaged. The cavern became a maelstrom of violence as the party attempted to catch up to aid the party.
> 
> Kovinar‚Äôs devotion to Bahamut erupted into the open. A platinum dragon‚Äôs maw yawned wide behind him, its roar shaking the stone itself. For one frozen heartbeat, time stilled. Allies healed as the divine presence crashed across the battlefield, even as Halric staggered under its weight.
> 
> But Halric struck back with fury, nearly cutting down Varian and Kovinar both. At last, Kovinar seized his greatsword, driving it through Halric and cleaving him in two. In the stillness that followed, the party rifled through his remains. Among them lay a scroll‚Äîbearing the terrible incantation of the _[[Mind Chains\|Mind Chains]]_, a bearer's deed to the mine, still wet with Halric‚Äôs blood, and a small fortune.
