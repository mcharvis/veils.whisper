**Players Present:** Ryan, Tristan, Christine, Mike Charvis, Mike Crump 

## Introduction
> Prepare to Die
> 
> Last time, you learned what it feels like to be hunted by things that do not get tired.
> 
> You found the **Harbinger Sword** in ash and ruin—close enough to touch, close enough to die for—but it wasn’t truly visible to everyone. The **Four Horsemen** tore through the wreckage again and again in desperate fury, circling a prize they couldn’t see. When you finally collapsed, broken and bleeding, **Conquest** refused to leave empty-handed. He grabbed **Lucian** by the breastplate and threw him across a warhorse like stolen property.
> 
> You woke in **Vindictive Enterprises’ organ hospital**, strapped down, stripped, and missing your gear. The air stank of rot and antiseptic, and the lights swung like the place couldn’t decide if it was a clinic or a slaughterhouse. **Dr. Severin Vile**—masked, calm, and thrilled—made it clear you weren’t prisoners. You were inventory. He planned to carve you slowly, keep you alive, and sell you a dozen times. You broke free, found **Renzo** unconscious on an operating table, and fought through Vile’s attendants in tight, ugly rooms until the butcher finally died.
> 
> You traced the rot upward and found out it had patrons.
> 
> You met **Veyra Light**, a collector with a museum full of carefully labeled sins. You needed a **Ledger Seal**. She wanted payment in something rare enough to matter, and her attention kept circling the idea of **Ashrend**, a vampiric killing sword. Beneath her museum was a hidden vault protected by layered glyphwork—treasure locked under cascading wards meant to punish greed, curiosity, and impatience.
> 
> You hit the supply chain next.
> 
> North of Helfirth, you walked into a **VE orc mercenary camp**—the main buyer for Vile’s harvested organs—and learned someone had put **10,000 gp bounties** on each of your heads. You stormed the camp, cut down guards and officers, and then a young orc girl stumbled out—**Junebug**—sword dragging, eyes cold, and rage too big for her body. **Varian** tried to stop her and killed her by accident. For a blink, the world fractured in his mind: a childhood farm burning, parents screaming, raiders in smoke—then the shadow of the **Black Wolf** and those merciless eyes. When the vision snapped back, Junebug lay in the dirt. Varian brought her back anyway. He gave her his flail. She decided you were heroes. She started calling him **Captain Muscles** and Vespertina **SuperSparkles**, like naming you could make the world less cruel.
> 
> Then you struck Vindictive Enterprises where it hurts.
> 
> You entered the sanitation sector in **Operation Redflow**, a maintenance underworld where everything hummed, dripped, and moved like a body trying to digest its own filth. You fought technicians, an overseer, and the reclaimer, shut down power, reversed the pumps, and flooded VE with excrement. You turned their machine against itself and left them drowning in what they thought they could hide.
> 
> But the Harbinger still pulled at the world.
> 
> You brought the sword to the **First World Tree** to bury it somewhere obsession couldn’t reach. The Tree answered with trials—**the Seven Deadly Sins** as manifestations, not real enemies, but real pain. In that place, **Renzo died** and faced **Nerull**, and the campaign reminded you: death here is not a line you cross once. It’s a presence that watches for you to slip.
> 
> When **Wrath** rose, the **Scarlet Raven** carved through you with ease. You went blind under Murder’s Eclipse, and it should have ended there—until a flash of gold split the dark and a figure with a greatsword ended the Raven’s avatar in three strikes. The one who saved you wasn’t a hero.  He was Sir Lucian, The Oath Rekindled.
> 
> A man sat on bare stone with no camp and no fear. He spoke like this was inevitable. Then his skin split into scale and wing, and **Maldravok**, an ancient deep dragon, promised that anything you hid in that chamber would never leave while he still breathed.
> 
> You moved toward Vis’Avae next, and the world changed texture.
> 
> At the black river, **Charon** demanded blood for passage—loyalty proved in pain. **Velura** stepped forward first, then cut **Miren’s** palm, and the river drank eagerly. When each of you paid, the river gave judgments that felt less like blessings and more like being recorded: **Remembered. Favored. Redeemed. Clever. Untamed. Enduring.** Velura crossed ahead with Miren and warned you plainly: the inner realm doesn’t care if you’re good. It cares if you’re resolute.
> 
> Then the tests began.
> 
> **Eimear** made you cross the **Bridge of Pale Glass**, where conviction mattered because hesitation broke the world beneath your feet. **Saoirse** led you into the **Hall of Chains**, where the wards had inverted and the innocent were bound while the condemned walked free, forcing you to choose who deserved release and who needed binding. **Niamh** trapped you in the **Hall of Mirrors**, where reflections lied, statues tracked movement through angles you couldn’t predict, and light itself became a weapon.
> 
> In the woods, the world turned quiet in a different way.
> 
> You chased **luminae** to a fey garden and found the **Scarlet Raven** on her knees, shaking, grieving, holding something small and lost. When you approached, she didn’t fight. She walked through your blows like she needed the pain to feel real. Then she reached **Kovinar**, pressed his hands to her heart, rested her forehead against his, and left without explanation—flying off into the dark as if the only thing she trusted was distance.
> 
> At the Statue of the First Vis’Ar, **Caoimhe** told you growth only happens when something gets fed. The **Devourer in Bloom** rose—made from your own vitality, your own defenses—and it could be weakened only by sacrifice. **Kovinar** chose the brutal option. He died willingly. He faced **Nerull** again. The Devourer fell, and you walked forward carrying the cost of that decision like a fresh wound.
> 
> Then **Maeve** tried to break you with nothing but continuity.
> 
> In the **Hall of Doors**, every door opened into the same hall again. Every spell, every tool, every attempt to force progress only reset the trap. The only way out was to refuse to play—to stop moving, stop solving, stop proving yourself. When you finally did, the hallway decayed into dust and left one real doorway ahead.
> 
> That door opened to **Tisiphone**.
> 
> In the **Séance of Six Flames**, Velura and the sorceresses formed a circle of candles and hidden trials meant to test mind, nerve, and restraint. As the last flame locked upright and turned pale, something **noticed** you. Maeve’s eyes rolled white, then black, and a demon sent by Nerull—**The Watcher Beneath**—tore up through cracking stone. You fought to protect the candles, because if a flame went out, a spirit would be lost.
> 
> You held.
> 
> When the ritual completed, smoke fell like a curtain and you stepped into a ring of fey trees, each a different hue, surrounding the **Mosaic Die**. **Tisiphone** spoke the truth: you came for the shard of the **Death-Wrought Mosaic**, an artifact meant to twist fate hard enough to bind Nerull’s hands. She demanded proof that you could accept destiny, not just fight it—then made you roll the Mosaic to choose a **Whisper**, the soul that would guide you across the Veil where living flesh cannot go.
> 
> Fate chose **the Scarlet Raven** as the Veil’s Whisper.
> 
> Tisiphone gave you the shard, warned the Mosaic must be hidden beyond Nerull’s reach, and then she turned your eyes north. The horizon peeled back to show the **Pedronian Empire**—burning villages, shattered fields, and six ronin clans that once stood united under **Caelen** now killing each other for nothing. She bound the path to **Renzo Morokami** and the last honor of House Takaren, and named your next objective: reunite the six clans under one banner to open the way to **The Hikarai**, a crystallum holding the **Tsukaru**, the gemstone needed to empower the **Crown of the Quiet Sovereign**.
> 
> That’s where we begin so prepare to die


## Summary
> The air in the tunnel is thick with the smell of wet stone, old blood, and the sour sweat of a party that has spent the last few hours fighting for every inch of ground. There’s no poetry down here—just the cold weight of your gear and the knowledge that the world above is currently a meat grinder.
> 
> It started in the valley, a place choked with enough ash to make every breath a struggle. You were supposed to be observers, watching the clans of **Son Goku** and **Elder Izanami** tear each other apart, but the battlefield has a way of swallowing the bystanders. The moment you were spotted, the war paused just long enough for both sides to decide you were a more convenient target than each other. You stood back-to-back, blades slick with clan blood, holding the line simply because there was nowhere else to go.
> 
> Then **Sovereign Amaterasu** arrived, and the fighting stopped because the air itself became a weapon. She didn't offer a challenge or a speech. She looked at **Renzo** and decided the ground he stood on didn't need to exist anymore. 
> 
> _“You should not be here,”_ the Sovereign’s voice echoed, a sound like grinding tectonic plates. _“You will not disrupt everything we control with your foolish faith. He is forgotten... and so shall you be.”_
> 
> The lightning didn't just strike; it hammered the earth with mechanical, gold-white violence until the valley floor shattered. You didn't just descend—you fell into a bone-jarring abyss, swallowed by a sinkhole that dropped you into a tomb lost to time.
> 
> The dark was immediate and hostile. You hit the floor of an ancient military complex, a place where the skeletons don't stay in the ground. You smashed through a **Skeleton Knight** and spent blood and exhaustion putting down a **Shadowclaw** that hunted you through the geometry of the ruins. The path forward was a dead end of solid stone until you found the trap door. You triggered the mechanism, listening to the scream of ancient gears as the stone rose to reveal a chamber that had been sealed for centuries to keep a secret in.
> 
> **Squeaks** crossed the threshold first into the heavy silence. When everyone else followed, the room woke up. **Varkhal, the Oath-Wrought Sentinel**, stepped out of the gloom. He looked at **Lucian**, recognizing the face of one of **Caelen’s** old guards, but the reunion was cold. When Lucian spoke of unity and the Hikarai, Varkhal shut him down with a blunt, ugly truth. It wasn't about strength or honor; Varkhal refused him because Lucian wasn't Japanese. A wall of heritage that no sword could cut through.
> 
> Then **Renzo** shed his wild shape, shifting from spider back to man. As he did, the mist in the chamber coiled into a statue of Caelen that looked less like carved stone and more like a man frozen in time. It was unnervingly real, every dent in the armor and every vein in the hand rendered with terrifying precision. Renzo walked up to it in a daze, raising his sword to match the statue’s weary, lethal stance. The party watched, frozen, as the statue’s shadow literally peeled off the wall and slid across the floor to lock onto Renzo’s.
> 
> When the shadow-meld broke, Renzo just shook it off, looking more annoyed than impressed. The rest of you were left standing in the dark, wondering what the hell you just saw. You didn't have long to think about it before a dozen more skeletons rose from the dust. You cut them down, one by one, until the floor was littered with bone and the silence returned.
> 
> Now, you’re huddled at the exit, taking a long rest you haven't earned but desperately need. The surface is waiting, and Amaterasu has already made it clear she wants Renzo dead. You’re heading back up into the ash, but the man walking with you might not be the same one who fell down here.
