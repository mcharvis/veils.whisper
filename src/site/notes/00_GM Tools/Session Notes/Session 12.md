**Date:** 1/24/26
**Location:** Christine's House  
**DM:** Mike
**Players Present:** Ryan, Tristan, Christine, Mike Charvis 

## Introduction
> Prepare to die. 
> 
> Torchlight fades. The cave stays cold. Your armor and packs are piled close because nobody trusts the dark down here.
> 
> Hours ago, the surface betrayed you.
> 
> You walked up on Son Goku locked in combat with Izanami. Before you could even decide how to approach, both clans turned on you—together. Outsiders. Convenient targets. You held your ground long enough to keep breathing, long enough to keep each other standing.
> 
> Then Sovereign Amaterasu arrived to defend Izanami.
> 
> She didn’t speak. She didn’t warn you. She struck.
> 
> Lightning came down in a volley. Stone cracked. The ground broke apart under your feet. You dropped into the open dark and hit hard, far below the battlefield, in a cave lost to time
> 
> A skeleton knight met you down there. You pushed deeper, still not sure if you were escaping or being funneled somewhere on purpose.
> 
> A Shadowclaw found you next. You killed it, but it took time and blood.
> 
> Then you found the stone door with no way through
> 
> You found the trap door and the fiery stone beneath it. You triggered the mechanism and watched the stone rise, lifting the door and revealing a chamber that was never meant to be discovered.
> 
> Squeaks crossed first.
> 
> Nothing happened.
> 
> Then the rest of you stepped in, and the room changed immediately.
> 
> Varkhal, the Oath-Wrought Sentinel, looked past most of you and focused on Lucian. He recognized him—one of Caelen’s old guards. Lucian didn’t flinch. He told him why you came: to reunite the clans and open the Hikarai.
> 
> Varkhal refused the idea outright.
> 
> He said it was impossible. Not because you lacked strength, not because you lacked proof, but because Lucian wasn’t Japanese.  
> 
> Then Renzo dropped from wild shape.
> 
> Renzo transformed out of wild shape and a magnificent statue of Caelen appears from the mist. The statue appeared strangely realistic. Renzo Stands because the statue and gazes absently at it... Raising his sword in the same way the statue does. The party watches in awe as a shadow from the statue appears to move from the wall over Renzo in a perfect match. Renzo snaps or if his daze, somewhat unimpressed. The party looks at each other, confused about what they just witnessed.
> 
> After cutting down a dozen skeletons, the party long rests at the exit. Now they prepare to ascend to the surface... Confused about what happened and what will happen next. One thing is certain, sovereign Amaterasu seemed determined to eliminate Renzo but it's not clear why. If the gods are determined to kill Renzo, we must be prepared to die.

## Summary
> The air tasted like ash and copper, the lingering weight of a world that had been broken and roughly stitched back together in a single, bloody night. The survivors stood in the wreckage of **[[02_World/The Pedronian Empire\|The Pedronian Empire]]**, breathing in the stagnant remains of a war that had finally burned itself out.
> 
> It began in the suffocating dark of **[[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]]**’s mind. **[[Samantha\|Samantha]]** had cornered him in his own dream, not to offer comfort, but to strip his spirit bare. She tore into his devotion to **[[06_NPCs/Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]]** with a serrated tongue, mocking the labels he used to protect himself. _"Good is a label people slap on power they’re afraid to question,"_ she spat, watching the paladin struggle. She laid the blood of the child, **[[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]]**, at his feet, mocking the "illusion of choice" that **[[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]]** had used to turn a paladin into an accomplice. Her voice echoed with a final, chilling directive: _"Don’t hand your spine to a dragon and call it faith. Ask your god to forgive my descent into evil, Kovinar. It is the only way."_ Before vanishing, she forced the **Six Commands of the [[Forgotten Hero\|Forgotten Hero]]** into his custody and left him with a blunt ultimatum: _"Just finish it."_
> 
> When the party finally clawed their way out of the depths, they were met by the cold steel of **[[06_NPCs/Elder Susanoo\|Elder Susanoo]]** and **[[06_NPCs/Son Goku\|Son Goku]]**. The air hummed with impending slaughter. **[[05_Player Characters/Renzo\|Renzo]]** attempted to seize command with the charisma of a leader, but the clans remained unmoved. It was only when **[[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]]** remembered **[[Samantha\|Samantha]]**’s warning—_“When we surrender, we rise from the flames of our misfortune”_, that the power shifted. He didn’t command with pride; he commanded through the acceptance of his own failure. The words **"Stand down"** didn't just carry weight; they carried the authority of the grave. The clans obeyed.
> 
> The journey through the empire was a gauntlet of shifting loyalties and divine wrath. They navigated pagodas choked with conflicting orders and weathered the storms of **[[06_NPCs/Raijin\|Raijin]]** and **[[06_NPCs/Fujin\|Fujin]]**. In the end, it was **[[05_Player Characters/Renzo\|Renzo]]** who paid the ultimate price. To break the stalemate, he offered his life to the fury of **[[06_NPCs/Sovereign Amaterasu\|Sovereign Amaterasu]]**, who looked upon him with divine disdain. _"He is forgotten... and so shall you be,"_ she declared. As his body broke under her radiant wrath, the veil tore open. The spirit of **[[Caelen\|Caelen]]** reached through the gap, snatching **[[05_Player Characters/Renzo\|Renzo]]** back from the God of Death. The party turned the gods' own power against them, commanding the clans to deny the Sovereigns. Without the fuel of worship, **[[06_NPCs/Sovereign Amaterasu\|Sovereign Amaterasu]]** and **[[06_NPCs/Tsukuyomi\|Tsukuyomi]]** faded into the ash. **[[05_Player Characters/Renzo\|Renzo]]** remained behind, a living reliquary for **[[Caelen\|Caelen]]**, to rule the ruins of an empire that finally knew its master.
> 
> The remaining companions pushed into the **[[Hikarai\|Hikarai]]**, discovering a chamber of thirteen severed heads with sewn-shut mouths. They navigated a lethal cipher, ignored a red-painted herring, and put down a **Death Knight** that rose from a bald man's skull. From the correct pike, they claimed the **[[tsukaru\|tsukaru]]**, a raw gemstone that felt heavy with the cost of their journey. But as they emerged, a new shadow fell over them. **[[06_NPCs/Pets/Wilson\|Wilson]]**’s breath simply stopped. For several minutes, he was a corpse. When he finally gasped back to life, a faint, rhythmic thumping could be felt in his chest—a second heartbeat, out of sync and alien, marking time for something other than a man.
> 
> The night sky offered no peace. Under a canopy of black clouds, **[[06_NPCs/Malphas\|Malphas]]** appeared—a towering silhouette of horns and wings. He spoke with the calm certainty of a predator who had already won. _"My loyal servant was true to their word. They opened the Hikarai... and have delivered the stone,"_ he said, his voice carrying without effort. Then, with a cold finality, he issued his terms: _"Relinquish the stone, and I shall grant you a swift demise. Defy me… and your soul will beg for freedom... ever... more."_ He dismantled the party with terrifying ease, sealing **[[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]]** inside a sacrificial tower to await the end.
> 
> The bells of **[[Vex Ceniza\|Vex Ceniza]]** broke the silence. Scarlet ravens flooded the sky, and **[[Samantha\|Samantha]]** tore through the tower’s stone like it was parchment. She didn't come with a prayer; she came with a sneer. _"What the fuck are you doing in here? Praying?"_ she barked at **[[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]]**. _"The bad guy is outside. Mommy's here and timeout's over."_ She looked at the bloodied party and added, _"You guys fight like shit,"_ before weaving runes of blood and shadow that turned them into a murder of invisible ravens and winged hunters. Together, they cornered **[[06_NPCs/Malphas\|Malphas]]**. **[[Samantha\|Samantha]]** gripped the creature's head and disintegrated his mind while **[[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]]** took the trophy of his neck.
> 
> In the quiet aftermath, **[[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]]** appeared to claim the cooling remains of **[[06_NPCs/Malphas\|Malphas]]**, his presence a grim reminder of who truly owns the dead. **[[05_Player Characters/Vespertina\|Vespertina]]** handed **[[Samantha\|Samantha]]** the **[[Items/Book of the Profane Word\|Book of the Profane Word]]**, a relic of the God of Death himself. With a curt, stoic _"Thanks,"_ **[[Samantha\|Samantha]]** turned her back on the party and vanished. The **[[Oracle\|Oracle]]** arrived soon after, her voice trembling. _"I can see most lives in this place but I can no longer locate Samantha,"_ she whispered. _"She has disconnected herself from the world."_ The woman was no longer a thread in the tapestry; she was a wildcard loose in a world that was already burning.
