# False Bottoms and Forgotten Children

**Date:** 07/28/2025
**Location:** Christine's House  
**DM:** Mike
**Players Present:** Ryan, Tristan, Christine, Jesus, Mike 

---

## Introduction
> **‚ÄúPrepare to die.‚Äù**  
> Your long rest offered little comfort. Sleep came, but not peace. Dreams flickered with firelight and whispering bones. Every shadow stretched too long. Every silence felt‚Ä¶ aware. Something was watching. Is _watching_.
> **Xaphan** is gone... Not just _missing_, not just _taken_‚Äî1,600 years gone. Ripped through time and into shadow. Sixteen hundred years behind you, and yet somehow still ahead.
> Three of you now carry his burdens: a cursed cross, the Veiled Necrovitalis, and a stolen shard of the Death-Wrought Mosaic. Each one humming with purpose. Each one whispering of the Veil.
> The embers of the **Night Camp** have burned to ash. Cold descends over you. Farr√∫n's skeletal remains lie still - his voice, hers really - still echoing in your minds. A mother‚Äôs warning, scorched and half-swallowed by time, read too late to be heeded.
> But fragmented mosaic has seemingly cut your journey sideways‚Äîtoward the faint traces of a child - **M** - who you believe wandered into a place called **[[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]]**. A place that should promise shelter; that should promise sanctuary. A place, her mother warned, _must be avoided at all costs_.
> You‚Äôve already accomplished what legends could not...you've escaped The Temple of the Forgotten Hero. 
> But here in **Elarith**, even the extraordinary fades like breath on glass. Glory is fleeting. Memory lies.  
> And death‚ÄîDeath is only the opening act.
> So again...
> **Prepare to die.**

## üß≠ Summary
> The party pressed deeper into the ruin of the Whispering Asylum, following the faint psychic traces of the child known only as ‚Äú[[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|M]].‚Äù The halls were haunted‚Äînot just by ghosts, but by the residue of suffering. Faintlings skittered and whispered nonsense. [[06_NPCs/Magda Velt, The Lunch Matron\|The Lunch Matron]], long dead, still served slop with eerie joy.
> Inside, the party experimented with recipes from [[Puzzles/Good Girls Heal Fast\|Good Girls Heal Fast]], crafting dishes that offered magical boons‚Äîor dangerous side effects. Squeaks discovered a toy dagger that turns to iron when it nears flesh. They solved cryptic puzzles left in [[Puzzles/Stuffed Bear Riddles\|teddy bears]], unlocking magical items including [[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]]‚Äôs [[Items/Magical/Nasha's Red Blanket\|Red Blanket]], a Hat of Disguise, and [[Items/Magical/Forgotten Memory Charm\|a peculiar charm shaped like a children‚Äôs block]].
> Then they found her‚ÄîNasha *(later discovered to be the abandoned lovechild of Sanctifiers Halric and Virelle)*‚Äîa tragic figure twisted by neglect, wielding psychic power and deep resentment. The battle was fierce. Squeaks unknowingly used Nasha‚Äôs own blanket to steal some of last little bits of life she had.
> In the aftermath, the party uncovered the true horror behind the Asylum. A locked drawer gave up plenty of secrets: logs of torture, erased photos of [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]], and letters hinting at her Miren‚Äôs captivity and the beast contained beneath [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]]. The party found a disturbing archive of drawings, punishment logs, and architectural plans revealing a hidden sub-level. The name of the Headmistress, [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]], surfaced at last‚Äîformer graduate of [[02_World/Ahrown, The Kingdom of Elves/Talazan Academy\|Talazan Academy]] turned cruel overseer. Her obsession with control and secrecy had driven her to torture the children, recording their ‚Äúprogress‚Äù in a twisted gradebook. Worst of all, she had used the bathtub in her own quarters as a disposal site, concealing a false bottom to a basement to hide their bodies. The party recovered one such body‚Äîa young girl‚Äîin the tub (too light to trigger it) and gave her a proper funeral in the flames.
> The party discovered a mosaic altar. Squeaks, drawn by insight cast her piece of the Death-Wrought Mosaic into the bowl, triggering treasure as well as tricks...
> Then came vengeance.  
> The party confronted Headmistress [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]] in the classroom. Vespertina was struck down by the very gradebook that recorded the children‚Äôs pain. But in death, she faced the Trial of Nerull and survived His judgment. She returned unchanged, but furious. Squeaks trapped the cruel headmistress. While suspended upside down, Calvra looks at Vespertina and says "I'll kill you again, you bitch!" as Vespertina claims her revenge...delivering 5 Magic Missiles as the final blow to the woman who turned teaching into torture.
> Kovinar, robbed of speech by the Bright Green Soup, plummeted through the false-bottom tub in silence‚Äîonly to find his voice again in an instant, echoing ‚ÄúFUCK!‚Äù upon impact. At last, the party climbed into the bathtub‚Äîinto the dark belly of the Asylum itself‚Äîand descended into the basement. There they found it waiting: [[06_NPCs/The Cradle of Flesh\|The Cradle of Flesh]], a pulsating mass of sorrow and stitched-together remains. Renzo cast _Entangle_, vines ripping through the stone and rooting the creature in place. The party surrounded it‚Äîand destroyed it.
> The party chose to take a long rest within the very halls that tortured children for decades. Vespertina, in bitter irony, laid her head in [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]]‚Äôs bed‚Äîthe same place where cruelty once dreamed‚Äîand finally, for a moment, they all peacefully slept.
> Now, with the possibilities of the [[Items/Magical/Death-Wrought Mosaic\|Death-Wrought Mosaic]] whispering louder, and new questions rising‚Äîwho is Miren? Who is her mother? What is the Mouth?‚Äîthe party turns its eyes to [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]].
