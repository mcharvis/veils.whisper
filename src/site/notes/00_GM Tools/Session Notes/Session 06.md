# Blood of the Mad King

**Date:** 09/26/2025
**Location:** Tristan's House  
**DM:** Mike
**Players Present:** Ryan, Tristan, Christine, Jesus, Mike Charvis, Mike Crump 
 
## Introduction
> **Prepare to Die.**
> Renzo gave up more than words at the Threaded Hollow—he surrendered the memory of his own death, and admitted his greatest fear: that doing the right thing, done wrong, will be the end of him.
> 
> From there, the Chapel of Vex Ceniza brought forth a Withermaid, quickly cut down by Varian with Ashren. At the Ebon Reserve, whispers revealed a quest to recover the stolen ledger seal, stolen and rumored to be in the possession of Veyra, the Ashmonger. In the Sanctum of Withered Light, Dr. Brenden Gongol charged you with a greater task—to infiltrate Thornhold Keep and recover a sealed reliquary from its archives.
> 
> At Mithril Hills, the horrors closed in—blood pouring from your mouths, paranoia clawing at your minds, corpses brushing your faces, and a wall of darkness pursuing you. There, you mined Bloodfire Shards… and faced Sanctifier John Halric, who was discovered to have summoned Malphas. Kovinar called upon Bahamut, the cavern shook with divine fury, and Halric was finally cut down...nearly costing the lives of Kovinar and Lucian. From his corpse you claimed the scroll of _Mind Chains_, a bearer's deed to the mine, and a small fortune.
> 
> Now, the road bends north. Passage is secured. Ahead waits Ahrown, the kingdom of the Mad King.
> 
> If you're going to make it through Ahrown, you must be **prepared to die.**

## Summary
> When they left the mine, the world above had changed.
> 
> The city beyond the gates of Ahrown looked alive at first glance. A marketplace stretched across the street, crowded and loud. Merchants shouted, children ran between stalls, and the smell of cooked meat hung in the air. Banners moved in the wind. Coins clattered between hands. For a moment, it felt like life had returned to this place.
> 
> Then they noticed the repetition. A woman laughed in the same tone every thirty seconds. A man lifted the same fruit again and again. The juggler’s knives followed a perfect rhythm that never broke. The meat never burned. The smoke never shifted. The crowd never changed.
> 
> When Squeaks brushed against a merchant’s sleeve, the cloth was cold. The skin beneath was colder. The realization hit—none of this was real. The people weren’t alive. This was some kind of necromantic puppet-theatre powered by some magical force. 
> 
> They explored carefully. Every stall *sold* nothing. There were no prices. If anyone tried to take something, they were punished. A sharp pain hit the chest, hard enough to draw blood. **Greed was noticed.** When Squeaks pocketed a second item, the crowd froze. Every puppet turned its head toward her, their mouths opening in silent screams. Behind their unmoving eyes, trapped souls wept.
> 
> When they left the market, the noise of the illusion dropped away. Screams rose from the square ahead.
> 
> A crowd had gathered around a black iron rack, smoke rising into the sky. A tiefling woman was pinned to the ground beneath it. The man leading the crowd was dressed in necromancer robes.
> 
> “This tiefling filth dares to challenge our customs in Ahrown,” he shouted. “All life must be given back to the Mad King.”
> 
> The crowd smiled as if enjoying a show. A child pointed at the suffering woman while his mother hushed him gently. When the necromancer raised his hand, silence fell, then the chant began:  
> 
> **“Life to the Mad King. Life to the Mad King.”**
> 
> The woman begged for help, her voice cracking. Kovinar ended it quickly, striking a clean blow to stop her pain. The crowd cheered. Then they turned to the party and invited them to a “performance.”
>  
> They were led beneath a coliseum. The walls were wet, the floor slick with mud and blood. The roar above was deafening—thousands of voices, all without words. The gate ahead was black iron. Beyond it glowed torchlight. A man entered dragging a bucket that smelled like decay. He didn’t speak. When the gate began to rise, the crowd’s sound swelled to a wall of noise.
> 
> The party was shoved forward into the arena.
> 
> **The Mad King** watched from a high throne, his armor corroded but still regal. His grin was wide and wrong.
> 
> “Behold them!” he shouted. “The fortunate few, chosen to stand on our sacred stage! Do you not envy them?” He stood, arms spread. “Their blood will feed the sands. Their screams are our hymn. Begin!”
> 
> The battles came in waves. The first wave brought **wights and ghasts**, the air thick with rot. The second wave was **a wraith and four specters**, howling as they struck. Then came **two vampire spawn**, and finally a **death knight**. Each victory only made the crowd louder. When it was done, the party stood bloodied but alive.
> 
> They were offered rest, and a promise to meet the King himself.
>  
> The throne room was vast, lit by stained glass that cast black light across the floor. The Mad King sat hunched forward, his crown tilted, eyes dull but sharp when they met theirs.
> 
> “Outsiders again,” he said. “It’s always the filthy Tharnils that survive the flood. Ahrown is not a place for the living. Why has Nerull sent you here? To beg? To steal?”
> 
> He looked at each of them in turn, but to Vespertina: “you...you wear your father’s clothes. Tell me, witch, is this Nerull’s trick? Or some other sorcery?” Vespertina tells him that her appearance is the result of a curse. 
> 
> He stands up and snaps at her. “Spare me from the pitiful meanderings of your cursed backstory, witch. We are All cursed here. The living are already dead...even these fools understand that.”
> 
> Then, quieter: “Forgive me...I've been accused of madness in the past... Do you know when the line between the living and the dead blurred for me? I do. I remember. One life, then another, and another. Blood dries fast—faster than you think. Death never left me. He whispers to me when the world is still. He knows me… better than I know myself.”
> 
> He looked at Vespertina again. “So much fire in you. Like your mother, I’d guess. But you stink of death... perhaps like your father.” 
> He rose, the madness shifting into something heavier. “You have seen death. You are no stranger to me, Vespertina. You are not some lost soul wandering into my court. Nerull controls the strings of fate in Elarith. You are a trick...you're not real!!! You think I don't recognize the clothes on your back? I know how to settle this once and for all. Behold and gaze upon my face Princess Vespertina Galanodel; Do you not recognize the face of your father!"
> 
> The truth sank in slowly. The Mad King of Ahrown, was her father, King Aldenor of Elarion—killed by the very bargain he made with Nerull to save her life. He explained how her uncle Rauconen had plotted against her, how Aldenor had offered his own soul to keep her safe. Nerull had twisted that deal. Vespertina lived and Aldenor died. His soul was dragged to Elarith—where he had discovered a way to rule another kingdom, completely dead, completely mad in longing for his daughter.
> 
> He stepped closer to her, his tone almost gentle. "I need something from you. In the depths below lies a woman...a necromancer wearing the **Black Sigil**. She clings to stolen power. Bring it to me. Tear it from her crown.”
> 
> He leaned forward. “Do this, not just for your king, but for your father.”
>  
> At the Bottomless pit, a black wound yawned before them, so wide the edges curve into shadow. Light dies beyond the rim. No bottom. No echo. And as you stand at the edge, they know...it isn’t empty down there. The air around it was cold and still. They descended by rope, torches burning weakly in the growing dark. The further they went, the more voices they heard—whispers, pleading, laughter that never stopped.
> 
> At two hundred feet, they saw bodies pinned in the walls, eyes open and unmoving. At six hundred, the torches began to die. At a thousand, the air tasted like iron. At fifteen hundred, the darkness swallowed them completely. They could hear breathing all around them, close and wet. Fingers brushed against their armor and faces. They were surrounded by the half-living, pressed into the stone, waiting.
> 
> At the bottom, the ground gave way to a fragile platform suspended over blackness. It creaked under their weight. Then came the voice.
> 
> “You’ve come a long way…to die.”
> 
> It was **Queen Vaeloria**, the true ruler of Ahrown before its fall. Her voice moved through the air like she was standing behind each of them in turn.
> 
> “He sent you, didn’t he? Aldenor, still clutching his false crown. Still pretending he is king while his city rots.”
> 
> The platform shifted. Something unseen moved closer. “I was Queen before him. I commanded the throne before he drowned it in madness. This Sigil, this throne, this kingdom—they were mine.”
> 
> The whisper brushed their skin. “He calls me monster, but what do you call a man who steals what was never his?” Then silence.
> 
> After a long calculated battle in complete darkness, Vespertina crushed the **Crimson Phylactery** on the back of her head.  Vaeloria’s voice screamed and vanished. The crown fell to the platform.  
>  
> When they returned, Aldenor waited in his hall with explanation for their discovery. “I took her throne,” he said plainly. “She held the crown before me. It was by treachery that I wear it now. But do not mistake me...I am king of Ahrown, and you are its princess.”
> 
> He stepped forward, his expression softer. “My sweet princess… the curse has hidden you from yourself too long. Let me restore it.”
> 
> He touched her brow, gold light bursts from his crown, and the illusion that had masked her heritage lifted. Then he handed her an old black tome bound in black flesh—the **Book of the Profane Word**, one of Nerull’s spellbooks.
> 
> **Daughter… our kingdom teeters on collapse.** In this box is no gift, no treasure—only a curse. This beacon does not rest; it whispers, it calls. It can only be seen by it's bearer. With each hour it lingers, the hoofbeats come closer. If I keep it here, our bones will become fodder for the Horsemen’s feast.
> 
> He gestures to the sealed crate, though to all eyes it looks empty...except for the eyes of Vespertina. Only she sees the gleam of steel within, the faint shimmer of a blade.
> 
>  “This is the Harbinger Sword. In their hands, it is the end of all things. Every company I have sent to carry it has returned broken, hollow-eyed. But you… I trust you, daughter.”
>  
>  His fingers tremble as he grips the crate tighter, as if he might crush the wood rather than let it slip free.
>  
>  “South of here, beyond the merchants and the liars, beyond the scars of war… lies the First World Tree. Its roots are older than Nerull’s whispers, older even than death. If there is any place strong enough to swallow this cursed beacon, to bury it where even the Horsemen cannot claw it back—it is there.”
> 
> A pause. His hollow eyes bore into Vespertina’s, filled with equal parts command and fear.
> 
> “Good luck, my child; This will not be easy. You're friends may betray you. If you fail, it will not be only our crown that rots...it will be all that is.”
