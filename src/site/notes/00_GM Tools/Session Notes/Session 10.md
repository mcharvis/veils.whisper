## Introduction
> Prepare to die 
> 
> When you climbed out of the mine, the world above didn’t feel like the same place you left behind. Ahrown greeted you with noise, color, and motion—until you realized every sound repeated, every gesture looped, and every smile was carved into dead faces. The market was nothing more than a necromantic stage show, powered by trapped souls forced to pretend they were alive.
> 
> From there, things only worsened. You watched a tiefling woman condemned by a crowd that couldn’t feel sadness. You spared her the cruelty of what was coming, and the puppets around you applauded as if they’d seen a fine performance.
> 
> Down in the coliseum, you fought wave after wave of the undead while thousands of hollow voices cheered from above. And when you finally stood before the Mad King… you learned he wasn’t a stranger at all.
> 
> King Aldenor of Elarion—long thought dead—sat on that throne. Still wearing the crown, still clinging to purpose, but twisted into something desperate and half-rotted. His bargain with Nerull had saved Vespertina’s life, and cost him everything else. He didn’t recognize her at first, but once he did, his rage cracked and the truth came through. She was his daughter. He had been dragged here after death. And he had built this kingdom out of madness and longing.
> 
> He sent you into the Bottomless Pit to retrieve the Black Sigil. You descended past bodies pinned in stone, past whispers that clung to your ears, until you reached Queen Vaeloria—the rightful ruler of Ahrown—still struggling to reclaim her power. Her death by Aldenor's daughter... shattering the Crimson Phylactery against the back of her head.
> 
> When you returned, Aldenor used the crown to remove the curse hiding Vespertina’s heritage...but gave her one last burden: **the Harbinger Sword** a blade that can only seen by its bearer. A blade hunted by the Horsemen. A beacon strong enough to call them.
> 
> He told her the truth plainly:  
> Ahrown is rebuilding.  
> The blade cannot stay here.  
> If it does, the Horsemen will claim everything.
> 
> He told you where it must go—south, toward the First World Tree—but he also told you something else: if you surrender the Harbinger sword...it is the end of all things. Good luck, my child; This will not be easy. You're friends may betray you. If you fail, it will not be only our crown that rots—it will be all that is..
> 
> The road south cuts through Vis’Avae, the ancient forest city held by Tisiphone. One of the abandoned sisters. One of the few beings powerful enough to warn you, guide you, or kill you depending on her mood. Her realm decides who enters the First World Tree and who doesn’t. If you want a chance to bury the Harbinger Sword, you need an audience with her. And she does not offer audiences freely.
> 
> Ahrown is behind you. Its illusions, its crowds, its king made of memory and regret. Now the task is clear.  
> Bury the Sword. Reach Vis’Avae. Earn Tisiphone's favor.
> 
> The path opens into dark woods.  
> And if the Sword whispers, you know why— the Horsemen are already listening... so you must be prepared to die.

## Summary
> The chronicles of the travelers were no longer mere memory; they were etched in blood, ash, and the shifting tides of fate.
> 
> The tale began in the choking embers of ruin, where the companions first learned the weight of being prey to things that do not tire. They had laid hands upon the [[Items/Harbinger Blade\|Harbinger Blade]], a blade of such terrible significance that even the [[Four Horsemen\|Four Horsemen]], limitless and unwearying, tore through the wreckage in a blind, desperate fury to claim it. The riders could not see the prize, yet they sensed its gravity. When the world finally broke the heroes and they collapsed, broken and bleeding, [[Conquest\|Conquest]] refused to leave empty-handed. He seized [[06_NPCs/Sir Lucian Caelmoor\|Sir Lucian Caelmoor]] by the breastplate and threw him across a warhorse like stolen property, vanishing into the gloom.
> 
> The group awoke not in a grave, but in the [[Organ Hospital\|Organ Hospital]] of [[Vindictive Enterprises\|Vindictive Enterprises]], strapped down and stripped. They became "inventory" under the masked gaze of [[06_NPCs/Dr. Severin Vile\|Dr. Severin Vile]], in a place that reeked of rot and antiseptic, where lights swung over a clinic that was truly a slaughterhouse. Vile planned to carve them slowly and sell them a dozen times over, but the companions broke free. They found [[05_Player Characters/Renzo\|Renzo]] unconscious on an operating table, fought through attendants in tight, ugly rooms, and finally ended the butcher’s life.
> 
> Seeking the [[Ledger Seal\|Ledger Seal]], the party traced the rot upward to [[06_NPCs/Veyra, the Ashmonger\|Veyra Light]], a collector with a museum full of carefully labeled sins. Her eyes hungered for [[Items/Ashrend\|Ashrend]], their vampiric killing sword, as they descended into a hidden vault protected by layered glyphwork—treasure locked under cascading wards meant to punish greed and impatience.
> 
> From the halls of gold, they hit the supply chain in the north. Outside [[Helfirth\|Helfirth]], they stormed a [[VE Mercenary Company\|VE Mercenary Company]] orc camp—the primary buyers for harvested organs—and discovered a staggering **10,000 gp bounty** had been placed on each of their heads. Amidst the slaughter, a young orc girl named [[06_NPCs/Funny/Junebug\|Junebug]] stumbled out, her rage too large for her small body. In a moment of fractured reality, [[05_Player Characters/Varian\|Varian]] killed her by accident, haunted by a vision of a burning farm and the merciless eyes of [[06_NPCs/The Black Wolf\|The Black Wolf]]. Yet, Varian brought her back. He gave her his flail, and in her eyes, they became heroes. She claimed them as her own, calling [[05_Player Characters/Varian\|Varian]] **"Captain Muscles"** and [[05_Player Characters/Vespertina\|Vespertina]] **"SuperSparkles,"** naming them to make a cruel world feel small.
> 
> The companions then struck [[Vindicative Enterprises\|Vindicative Enterprises]] where it hurt most: [[Operation Redflow\|Operation Redflow]]. In the dripping underworld of the sanitation sector, they fought through technicians and the Reclaimer, reversed the pumps, and flooded the enterprise with its own excrement—turning their machine of filth against itself.
> 
> But the [[Items/Harbinger Blade\|Harbinger Blade]] still pulled at the world. They brought it to [[02_World/The First World Tree\|The First World Tree]] to bury it beyond the reach of obsession. The Tree answered with the [[Seven Deadly Sins\|Seven Deadly Sins]]—manifestations of real pain. There, [[05_Player Characters/Renzo\|Renzo]] died and faced [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]], a grim reminder that death is not a line crossed once, but a presence that watches for a slip. When **Wrath** rose as the [[Scarlet Raven\|Scarlet Raven]], she carved through them with ease, leaving them blind under a Murder’s Eclipse. They were saved only by a flash of gold and a man who was no hero, but a gate to [[06_NPCs/Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]]...[[06_NPCs/Lucian, the Oath Rekindled\|Lucian, the Oath Rekindled]]. 
> 
> His skin split into scale and wing, revealing [[Maldravok\|Maldravok]], an ancient deep dragon who swore that anything hidden in that chamber would never leave while he still breathed.
> 
> To reach [[02_World/Vis’Avae\|Vis’Avae]], they crossed the black river where [[Charon\|Charon]] demanded blood for passage. [[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|Velura Elaris]] stepped forward first, cutting [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]]’s palm to sate the river's hunger. The water gave its judgments: **Remembered. Favored. Redeemed. Clever. Untamed. Enduring.** Velura warned them: the inner realm cares only for resolve.
> 
> The trials of the High Fae began in earnest:
> 
> - [[Eimear\|Eimear]] forced them across the [[Bridge of Pale Glass\|Bridge of Pale Glass]], where hesitation shattered the world. 
> - [[Saoirse\|Saoirse]] led them to the [[Hall of Chains\|Hall of Chains]], where the innocent were bound and the condemned walked free, forcing a choice of who deserved release. 
> - [[Niamh\|Niamh]] trapped them in the [[Hall of Mirrors\|Hall of Mirrors]], where reflections lied and light became a weapon. 
> In the fey gardens, they found [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|The Scarlet Raven]] again, not fighting, but grieving. She pressed her forehead to [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]]’s in a silent goodbye and fled into the dark. At the [[Statue of the First Vis’Ar\|Statue of the First Vis’Ar]], [[Caoimhe\|Caoimhe]] declared that growth requires a feeding. The [[Devourer in Bloom\|Devourer in Bloom]] rose, fueled by their own vitality. [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]] chose the brutal path, dying willingly to fell the beast and facing [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]] once more.
> 
> They were nearly broken by [[Maeve\|Maeve]] in the [[Hall of Doors\|Hall of Doors]], where every exit led back to the beginning. Only by refusing to play, by finding stillness in the loop, did the hallway decay into the door that led to [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]].
> 
> In the [[Séance of Six Flames\|Séance of Six Flames]], they formed a circle of candles to summon Tisiphone, bu [[Maeve\|Maeve]] refused to light her candle. [[05_Player Characters/Vespertina\|Vespertina]] chose to light it at the guidance of [[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|Velura Elaris]] but accidentally summoned [[06_NPCs/The Watcher Beneath\|The Watcher Beneath]], a demon sent by [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]]. They held the line, and as the ritual finished, they reached [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]]. She demanded proof that [[05_Player Characters/Squeaks\|Squeaks]] could accept destiny, and fate chose the [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|The Scarlet Raven]] to be their **Whisper**—the soul to guide them across the Veil.
> 
> With a shard of the [[Items/Magical/Death-Wrought Mosaic\|Death-Wrought Mosaic]] in hand, the path turned north to [[02_World/The Pedronian Empire\|The Pedronian Empire]]. They saw burning villages and the six Ronin Clans once united under [[06_NPCs/Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame\|Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame]], now slaughtering one another. For [[05_Player Characters/Renzo\|Renzo Morokami]], the last honor of [[The House Takaren\|The House Takaren]] remains: reunite the clans, reach [[The Hikarai\|The Hikarai]], and claim the [[Tsukaru\|Tsukaru]] gemstone to empower the [[Crown of the Quiet Sovereign\|Crown of the Quiet Sovereign]].
