		- "You shouldn't ask my that; you know I can't leave. I am the only stability left in this region. If I walked away now it would make things worse, so I can't do that. I can't promise my loyalty to you today, princess but I can promise small things...like a stolen hour when the watch allows. Find me when you can; I'll give you every second I can spare."
		- [ ] Social interaction with Liora
			- Kovinar, have you any sign of Drest? We can't seem to locate him. We sent a tiefling spy to Ahrown...but she hasn't reported back. We would check the VE but it's full or psychopaths and liars...so he'd blend right in. Halric is missing too. Drest had the intel on his location but there's nothing in Jade since the siege. We're stuck on locating him but he's crippled politically in Oasis.
