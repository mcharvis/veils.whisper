# Whispers of Treachery, Echoes of Escape

**Date:** 08/19/2025
**Location:** Christine's House  
**DM:** Mike
**Players Present:** Ryan, Tristan, Christine, Jesus, Mike Charvis, Mike Crump 

## Introduction
> **Prepare to die.**
> Darkness lingers heavy in Ya‚Äôa Thalor. Once a church of psychic priests, now only a husk of stone and silence. You entered its ruin not to pray, but to find Miren‚Äîand to uncover what festers below.
> You came upon desperate men, Jade Stronghold soldiers, fighting their last breaths against the dead. You saved one‚ÄîVarian‚Äîthough his bitterness burns hotter than his gratitude. Even spared from the grasp of Nerull, he curses the Stronghold with the *belief* that they sent him here to die. And in the depths you found not one prisoner, but two: Miren waits in her cell behind an enchanted door and Sanctifier Samantha Virelle has been broken to nothingness and left to choke in her own despair.
> Hopefully, it's not too late to rescue Velura imprisoned at Jade Stronghold.  
> You stand before the lower sanctuary, where the Dreaming Mouth waits. Slow. Relentless. Unforgiving.
> Step forward, mortals‚Ä¶and prepare to die.

## Summary
> In Ya‚Äôa Thalor, the party confirmed that the amulet from the Inescapable Room unlocked the council chamber to the Lower Sanctuary. There, the Dreaming Mouth rose‚Äîbut Renzo critically injured it in a storm of critical blows within a single round. Lucian‚Äôs strikes fell short, but the group held safe behind pillars. Loot was gathered: gold, cartographer‚Äôs tools, and an enchanted key.
> The party heard ominous bootsteps and believed, briefly, that was Virelle come to kill them. However, Seren of the Pale Flame appeared. ‚ÄúI knew Xaphan before the Fall.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need Tisiphone and the Bellum Crystallum‚Äîbut for that, safe passage through Ahrown.‚Äù 
> Seeking Virelle‚Äôs fate, they followed bloody footprints into the Whispering Asylum. A vision seized them: Samantha Virelle‚Äôs grief and rage erupting until Magda‚Äôs soul was unmade. > 
> In the forest beyond, they met Liora by lanternlight. She revealed that Varn Drest had sold Velura to the Sanctifiers, and reluctantly pressed a forged writ of entry into their hands. Velura, she said, lay in Jade Stronghold‚Äôs sixth-floor cell under Commander Velexia‚Äôs watch. ‚ÄúWe have about three days,‚Äù she urged. ‚ÄúExpose her imprisonment. Bring evidence. Drest cannot be allowed to bury this.‚Äù
> The clearing opened to the Stronghold, its obsidian tower veined with jade. Mounted knights, mastiffs, and a dire wolf guarded the gate. After tense words, Vespertina and Kovinar presented the writ and were admitted.
> Inside, the Stronghold became a maze of intrigue. Varian lied about his past, claiming loyalty to Oasis. Kovinar redeemed allies with Divine Salvation. The party gambled, drank, and mingled, gathering whispers: Velexia was lonely, Drest is corrupt, and the Stronghold braced for threat from sanctifiers. They uncovered burned reports, Sanctifier relics, tactical maps, and letters proving Drest‚Äôs dealings. Liora‚Äôs spies revealed more‚Äîevidence of funds funneled to the Sanctifiers, and a stunning truth: Halric faked his death.
> On the second night, the chance came. Squeaks distracted Drest's guard while Kovinar and Vespertina obtained critical information proving Drest's corruption. From the trees, dozens of Sanctifiers emerged‚Äîsilent, masked, armed. As the party assembled on the 6th floor, Kaelra was knocked unconscious and Velura‚Äôs cell unlocked with Velexia‚Äôs lost key. The party slipped into the Cinderflare wayfinder portal with Velura as Vespertina blasted the eastern was apart with a fireball directed at the bottle of Stronghold Spirit...seen as far as Ahrown.
> Grappling hooks flew, attaching to the 6th floor. Below, horns bellowed and the Stronghold fell under siege. Hidden in The Whispering Asylum, the party clutched Velura as she whispered: ‚ÄúThey‚Äôve come for me. Let‚Äôs go.‚Äù as the Portal slams shut. The stronghold fell into shambles as Commander Velexia informed Drest that Sanctifiers have breached the 6th floor.
