Mama,

I couldn’t stay any longer.

It wasn’t just the silence, or the chains, or the cold. It was what I was doing to them… and what she was doing to all of us.

The Headmistress said the punishments were for discipline. She said the lost ones had been “moved” or “healed.” But I saw what was in the basement. I saw the bodies…the monster. They said Peter “lost his marbles”; his marbles are there. She wasn’t healing us, mama. She was breaking us. Studying us. Torturing us.

And me—I was making it worse. The other children were hearing voices when I was near. They bled from their ears in their sleep. They screamed things that hadn’t happened yet. Every time I dreamed, something broke in them. I think I’m the reason Elsie snapped.

So I ran. I’m sorry the children have to stay. Can we save them?

I don’t know where I’m going, but I have to find you. 

Please forgive me for leaving. And please forgive me for not being strong enough to save the others.

M.
