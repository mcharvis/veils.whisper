The echo of the last blow faded.  
Steel falls silent. Blood finishes dripping. The dice has rolled… and then:  

**Bootsteps.**  
Distant. Steady. Heavy.

_Clink._  
_Clink._  
_Clink._

Screams and growls rip through the ruin—short, sharp, and then nothing.  
The steps continue. Closer.

_Clink._  
_Clink._  
_Clink._

In the dark hall beyond, **shadows flicker**—something moving, just out of sight.

Another step. A body drags across stone. A gurgling noise. Something snuffed out with finality.

_Clink._  
_Clink._  
_Clink._

Then she emerges.

A woman. Alone.  
Armor cracked, cloak frayed, boots crusted with blood. One gauntlet hangs loose from her hip. Her blade is already sheathed, but her presence is a weapon on its own.

She scans the room with eyes like burning coals doused in ash—tired, seething, cold.

No one speaks.

She looks to the mosaic. Then to each of you. A flicker of recognition in her gaze at Squeaks.

_Clink._  
_Clink._  
_Clink._

Finally, her voice cuts the silence—low, worn, resolute:

> **“I am Seren. I followed the prophecy to find you. I knew Xaphan...before The Fall.”**

A pause.

> **“And you’re still alive. So either you're blessed… or you're a problem for Nerull.”**

She takes a step closer, slow and unhurried.

> **“Either way, I’m not here to kill you. I came here with guidance.”**


> _“You’ll need to speak with Tisiphone. She controls the Bellum Crystallum where the second shard is—and she doesn’t grant audience to just anyone. Your only hope in obtaining the shard is to reach Vis’Avae... and for that, you’ll need transport through a land called Vindicative Enterprises. The only place with trade routes through there is the  kingdom of Ahrown...but you'll have to convince the Mad King to provide passage through the VE.”_
