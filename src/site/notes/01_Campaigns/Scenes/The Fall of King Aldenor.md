Rauconen’s ambitions had grown too large for his brother’s crown. He did not strike King Aldenor directly, but he began weaving webs around the throne—alliances with corruptible guards, cruel generals, secret pacts with foreign lords, and whispers that Vespertina was too young, too naïve, to rule. His solution was simple: **remove her name from the council or end her life.** After all...if she wasn't next in line, Rauconen could one day claim the Regency without resistance.

King Aldenor had discovered Rauconen's plot. He tried to subtly cut Rauconen down politically and legally, but the wheels of politics and legislation turn too slowly. In desperation and the need for assurance, he knelt before an unseen power whose name few elven dared whisper: [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]]. He was given a cruel bargain: offer his soul upon death in exchange for protecting Vespertina’s life from Rauconen. Because elves live a long life and believing that he could use his alliances with various sorcerers to prolong his life even further...King Aldenor confidently agreed believing that he had bested the God of Death.

...but he was tricked by Nerull.

The night of the attempt, assassins slipped into Vespertina’s chambers. Though King Aldenor had placed Vespertina under the watch of his most trusted veterans, one among them had already been turned by Rauconen’s quiet promises of power. On the night of the attempt, it was this guard who unbarred her chamber door while she slept and allowed the assassins to slip inside. 

The bargain with Nerull was fulfilled in the most perverse way. When the assassins’ blades plunged into a sleeping Vespertina, they passed through her body as though she were smoke. The steel shimmered, pulled across the palace by a power too vast to resist, and quietly buried itself in Aldenor’s heart where he slept next to her mother.

Vespertina awoke the next morning unscathed. Aldenor’s body was found mysteriously lifeless. To the court, it seemed a tragic coincidence—an invisible poison, a sorcerer’s curse, or even divine judgment. Rauconen had not meant for his brother to die, but he wasted no time stepping forward, mourning in public while securing power behind the scenes.

Aldenor’s bargain had been twisted. Nerull had spared Vespertina, yes—but he had redirected the death meant for her into the father who tried to save her. Bound by the pact, Aldenor’s soul was dragged into **Elarith**, the hell beneath the Veil, condemned to suffer as payment for daring to bargain with Death itself.

Now destined to spend an eternity in Elarith without his only daughter...[[06_NPCs/King Aldenor\|King Aldenor]] has slowly been driven mad in longing for her.

Vespertina has faced her father’s murderer not once, but twice—[[06_NPCs/Lord Rauconen\|Lord Rauconen]] in the flesh, and [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]] in the shadows.
