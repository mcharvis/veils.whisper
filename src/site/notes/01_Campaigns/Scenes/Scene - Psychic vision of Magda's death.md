The instant Magda Velt’s body slumped, the room sank with grief. Her ghost unraveled like smoke, and a **vision split open before the party’s eyes.**

You see a cloaked woman on her knees, broken, sobbing with a grief too large for her frame. **A half-orc** stands above her, voice confident and clear:

“I killed your daughter.”

The words hollowed Samantha. She collapsed forward, clawing at the floor, wailing until her throat tore raw as Vespertina and Squeaks left her alone...sobbing uncontrollably.

The weight of her losses consumes her. She lost her lover, her community, her faith...and now her daughter.

Virelle stumbles across the hall to the Inescapable Room and through the portal in Ya’a Thalor to [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]]. She sees the lifeless body of [[06_NPCs/The Cradle of Flesh\|The Cradle of Flesh]], recognizing the bodies of all the slain children that compiled it, and then claws her way up the iron ladder, through the false-bottom bathtub, through the Headmistress’ chambers.

At last, across the hall, she enters a dining hall. There sat [[06_NPCs/Magda Velt, The Lunch Matron\|Magda Velt, The Lunch Matron]]. Magda looks up from her bowl of broth, apron still dusted with flour, and her eyes shone with unshaken kindness.

“Well, what an unexpected surprise!” Magda said. “You’ve walked through shadows enough, dear. Rest for a spell. Eat! Try the soup. What's your name, child?”

For a time, Samantha obeyed, trembling as she ate bowl after bowl, letting the warmth of the green soup fill her hollow body, renewing all her strength, but unknowingly claiming her voice. Magda smiled gently, speaking as if to soothe a wounded animal. "Quiet, sweet girl. Eat. Eat, eat, eat!"

In casual conversation, Magda brings up the most remarkable thing she's seen in a long while. “They made quick work of that cruel headmistress, you know. That sorceress showed her. That little band of fighters. Even took care of Nasha, that evil girl in the storage. Braver than anyone gives them credit for, I say. I love them, Samantha. Truly, I do. They carry light into dark places like this.”

Magda's words snapped something inside Sanctifier Samantha Virelle. Rage instantly boiled up, consuming her, devouring her with grief and madness. Her spoon fell, clattering against stone.

Still staring at the table, fists clenched...unable to speak from the effects of the green soup, she mouthed “No,” hands shaking. Mouthing “Not them. Not Nasha.” But Magda couldn't hear her.

Magda only looked at her with sorrow. “What's the matter, child? They're kind peop'—”

The sentence was drowned in Virelle's rage....a scream breaking through the effects of the magical soup - a sharp, tearing scream, cracked and hollow, like metal scraping across bone. Virelle seizes Magda with both hands, and a shimmer of scarlet glassy light spreads from her palms; thin, brittle strands of soul-thread snap one by one, until Magda collapses into silence and is gone. 

Your vision shatters.

Now, in the present, chairs lay overturned, broth spilled, the memory of Velt soaking into the cracks of the floor. Magda is gone, first body ... now ghost, her final death delivered by Virelle’s hand.
