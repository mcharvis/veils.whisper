The Veil folds over you like wet cloth, and when you open your eyes, you feel the weight of exhaustion in your shoulders, the sting of sleeplessness behind your eyes. A voice whispering inside your head.

You see a desk covered in notes, drawings, and burned candles. You lean over a child lying on a cot. You murmur something...quietly and press your hand against the child’s forehead. Thin sigil marks of blue light spread from your palm. The child’s trembling eases. Their breathing steadies. You feel tears falling down your face. “You’re safe now,” she says. “You’ll never see your trauma again.”

The image snaps away.

You’re in a grey stone hallway lined with iron doors. The same sigils glow across the faces of screaming children but are not healing their minds anymore. A large commanding man stands nearby, hands folded, speaking to a group of robed men who take notes while a girl convulses on the floor. You step forward. “This isn’t right" you say..."This isn't what it it's for,” you say. The men don’t look at you. “We can use this,” the large man says. “They won’t hurt anymore,” you say.. You take another step. Now screaming “You’re hurting them.” He glances up and looks at you. “You made this. So use it.”

The vision fades.

You stand in a small room, tired...in pain. The high-pitched voice of a half-orc woman says “I killed your daughter.” You freeze. You can't catch your breath...as if there’s no air in the room anymore. No sound except the ringing in your ears. The world folds inward as you sob uncontrollably and watch two women abandon you...

The vision flickers

You’re kneeling on the ground. You watch as red light fades and soul-strand slip from your fingers like mist. You dart from the room in frantic desperation, in desperate search.

The vision swirls.

You slowly approach the body of a teenage girl. Her skin is cold. Her red blanket is damp from blood. You pick her up and pull her close, rocking slowly, your voice breaks as your heart does... You say, “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.” and you stay there for a long time.

Mist fades in and out

You’re in a small study. Books torn apart. Notes scattered across the room. Candles burned down to stubs. You’re flipping pages, muttering half-formed words. The floor is smeared with blood. You look at your hands to see where you’ve cut them searching through broken glass and parchment. “There has to be a way,” you say over and over...obsessively

The light changes again. 

Rain beats against the roof of an old chapel. You push the door open and walk inside, holding the red blanket. A young squire looks up from sweeping. “Ma’am, the chapel’s closed,” he says. You don’t answer. You walk straight past him to the altar of Vex Ceniza.

His voice fades and watches in awe of you as you lay the blanket across the altar. The fabric is still wet with your tears and the girls blood. You set both hands on it. The air feels heavy. A sound like slow breathing moves through the church. The torches burn red. You don’t look away. “I’ll give anything,” you say. 

Something stirs in the dark rafters above the altar. Ravens appear along the rafters, their eyes fixed on you. A low voice speaks—not kind, not cruel. 

The vision jumps and fades. 

The squire emerges from a pit, shouting. The bundle of skulls he was meant to bring for the spell never returns. The ritual circle cracks apart. The red blanket on the altar bursts into flame. You scream... in despair—as the chapel turns scarlet. Your body splits into hundreds and hundreds of scarlet ravens that spill into the night sky.

your vision blurs

You’re alone...again. The ground beneath your feet is soft with rain. You kneel in a fae garden, a small grave dug before you. You lower a girl's body into the soil. Your voice is rough and shaking. as you sob and curse the god of death for his absence, his cruelty, his neglect.

There’s movement behind you. Familiar people are standing in the mist. You rise and turn to face them

Your mind returns to the present. 

A winged-woman in a dark cloak appears to emerge the fog. Her eyes are red, her face calculatedly evil and hollow. She steps closer.

You stare at her and The Scarlet Raven stares back at you. 

The light goes out, and you’re thrown back through the Veil in front of Tisiphone.
