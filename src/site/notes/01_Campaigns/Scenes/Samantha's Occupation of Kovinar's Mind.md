The cave goes quiet the way it only can at night—fire down to coals, gear tucked close, everyone breathing slow.

Everyone drifts off to sleep but Kovinar is the last to drift away...

In the dream, he opens his eyes and there’s no cave. No fire. No walls. Just nothing—absolute darkness with no depth. He raises his hand in front of his face and can’t even see a silhouette.

He takes a step. There’s no sound.

A voice speaks inside his mind, calm and close.


> Your mind…is a dark place. This is not a mind free of turmoil. What are you fighting in here…? What…are you hiding …. In here? 
> 
> You’re close…I can feel your pain. I can see your demons.  Ah, there you are…
> 
> A familiar face….but not a familiar name. Who are you?
> KOVINAR: Kovinar...
> 
> VOICE: Kovinar….......Samantha.
> 
> SAMANTHA: Kovinar.....Do you believe in Bahamut?
> KOVINAR: yes.
> SAMANTHA: Why? 
> 
>**Do you think Bahamut is good?** 
> Samantha: “Good at what? Watching? You think ‘good’ counts if it doesn’t change anything when you’re bleeding? Good is a label people slap on power they’re afraid to question.”
> 
> **Do you think Bahamut gives you purpose?**
> Samantha: “Purpose is not proof. A sword has purpose too. So does a plague. You don’t believe because it’s true. You believe because it makes you feel less lost.”
> 
> **Have you seen his miracles?** 
> Samantha: “You saw coincidence and called it love. You saw survival and called it a plan. If your god is real, why do his ‘miracles’ always arrive late and small?”
> 
> **Did Bahamut save you?**
> Samantha: “He didn’t save you. You survived. Don’t hand your spine to a dragon and call it faith. If he saved you, why didn’t he save the ones who screamed longer than you did?”
> 
> **Did you make an oath to him?**
> Samantha: “An oath is a chain you agreed to wear. It’s not a reason. It’s a habit. You’re loyal because you’re afraid of what you’d become if you weren’t.”
> 
> **Do you need hope?** 
> Samantha: “Hope is a drug. It keeps you calm while you’re being butchered. Hope doesn’t win wars. It makes people easier to control.”
> 
> **Do you think Bahamut judges what’s right?**
> Samantha: “Right according to whom? Him? You outsourced your conscience. You call it righteousness. I call it permission.”
> 
> **Do you believe evil has to be opposed?**
> Samantha: “Then oppose it. Don’t pray at it. You keep asking your god for approval like a child. Pick a direction and pay the cost.”
> 
> Have you felt his presence?
> Samantha: “You felt comfort. That’s chemistry, not divinity. If your god is real, why does he only ‘speak’ when you’re desperate?”
> 
> Do you believe the world needs order?  
> Samantha: “Order is what people beg for when they can’t handle the truth. Order doesn’t mean justice. It means things stay predictable for the people in charge.”
> 
> Without him, are you anything? No.
> Samantha: “That’s the most honest thing you’ve said. You’re terrified. You don’t believe in Bahamut. You believe in not being alone.”
> 
> Does Bahamut stand against monsters ?
> Samantha: “He stands ‘against’ them from very far away. You’re the one who takes the hit. You’re the one who does the killing. Your god gets the credit.”
> 
> Nerull doesn’t fear your oath to [[06_NPCs/Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]]. He targets it.
> 
> He doesn’t challenge you because you’re dangerous—he challenges you because you’re principled. You can be forced. You can be manipulated.
> 
> He puts innocent children in front of you and makes you think you have no choice but to murder them. He uses mercy to kill tiefling women in the streets, then blames you for it. He robs you of knowledge so that he can corrupt your soul. You swore an oath of vengeance but delivered nothing…you allowed fear to prevail and chose to spare the torturers, and that makes you Nerull's accomplice, not her avenger. If you stay righteous, he kills what you’re trying to protect. If you compromise, he owns you for it.
> 
> [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]], recognize Nerull’s tricks. You encountered a feral, traumatized child and felt you had no choice but to end her life… Even as you ask if there was another way…you concluded that it was almost impossible. Nerull robbed you of the knowledge that her own mother created the magic that could eliminate Nasha’s trauma. Your journey started in an orphanage…not a church…not a stronghold. You felt you had no choice but to murder Nasha. I understand the illusion of choice, but I could have saved her, Kovinar. But alas, I couldn’t save her from [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]]… I couldn’t save her from you.
> 
> So understand this: your righteousness isn’t noble here. It’s predictable. And Nerull loves your predictability. Elarith does not ask good people to be great. It does not command you to be inevitable. You either are…or you aren’t. Your righteousness curses your future here. Every breath you take in this darkness is noticed.
> 
> Ask your god to forgive my descent into evil, Kovinar. It is the only way.
> 
> I have something but it curdles my blood to give it to you…
> 
> I am giving you this knowledge because those savages will not answer to me.
> 
> I have spent enough time pretending otherwise. If they ever could have, they would have done so by now.  
> 
> This war has dragged on past its usefulness and the conflicting banners have clouded my destiny. As expected, something always fills the gap left in the absence of guidance. It is never virtue, so don’t bother looking for it. There is virtue beside you now. Gods selfishly move first. Spirits follow. Immortal elders and mortal leaders imitate what they cannot control. None of them end the fighting. They only prolong it in forms that suit the respective sovereign…out of self preservation, I suppose. It is the sovereigns that keep the Hikarai closed, not the foolishness of men.
> 
> Listen to me…now.
> 
> Six commands were established by The Forgotten Hero in fear of this. His words are not meant to inspire loyalty or belief. They exist to reforge an ancient weapon. Each of these commands are bound to my fate. Each of these commands address the failures of men: 
> 
> - violence without conclusion
> - orders without hierarchy
> - authority without legitimacy
> - unity without cohesion
> - succession without continuity
> - divinity without restraint.
> 
> The words themselves are harmless. Written down, they do nothing. Spoken incorrectly, they do nothing. I know this because I tried. More than once. I cannot open the Hikarai. If I could, I would have no need for you. These commands are echoed only by the one recognized on the ground of war. Recognition cannot be simply taken. It either happens, or it does not. When we surrender, we rise from the flames of our misfortune.
> 
> The commands answer only to a voice of the living dead that stands where the cost of failure is paid immediately amongst the elders. I welcome the cost of failure…but my voice does not command the elders.
> 
> I am leaving in your custody my fate. Tisiphone claimed these commands were hidden by the sovereigns beneath Nerull’s veil so that realliance was impossible. She has given these commands to me and thus…assigned my fate an impossibility.
> 
> What was lost was not the commands. They were preserved carefully by Hecate. What was lost…what was forgotten…was the voice that bound them. That absence has lasted longer than expected. 
> 
> I am not that voice…but neither are you. None of you…
> 
> If that voice returns, the ground of war will not question it. It will obey. I will not stand in the way of fate. I am destined to find Nerull. I will find him…and I will destroy him. It is foolish to face the God of Death as long as the Hikarai remains closed.
> 
> Perhaps your god would one day offer me his grace. That is why my fate is your burden.
> 
> Do not look to me when the moment comes. Do not ask what follows.
> 
> Just finish it.
