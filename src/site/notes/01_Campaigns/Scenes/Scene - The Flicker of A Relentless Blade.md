The girl’s small hands tremble around the sword’s grip. The battlefield noise seems to die around her. She raises the blade, just as Varian’s comes swinging down.

And in that instant—before his steel meets her flesh—**the world flickers in Varian's eyes**.

He’s not in the mercenary camp anymore. He’s six years old, barefoot in the dirt of his family’s farm. His parents’ screams tear through the smoke as raiders descend. His tiny hands clutch a small sword, trying to stand between them and the fire. Too small. Too weak.

Then the shadow falls over him—towering, dark, a wolf’s-head cloak rippling in the firelight. The **Black Wolf**. His blade moves like lightning, cutting men down, leaving only silence. And then those eyes—those cold, merciless eyes—fall on Varian.

The boy stares up at him, cold and unyielding, and in that moment Varian sees it: the same cold and unyielding look in the girl’s eyes right now.

The vision snaps back into the present. The sword connects. The girl crumples, blood blooming across the dirt.

But burned behind Varian’s eyes is that **child’s face—his own face—caught in the gaze of a killer.**
