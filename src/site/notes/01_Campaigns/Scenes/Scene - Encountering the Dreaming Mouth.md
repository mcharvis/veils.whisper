The stairway ends in stillness. No doors. No guards. Just silence.

You emerge into a cold, hollow sanctuary—the air heavy and wet, as if breathing through cloth. Ten massive stone pillars line the chamber—five to each side—carved with weeping faces and spiraling, etched text in a language that shifts when stared at. 

In the middle of the room, between those columns, is something vast, heaving with a slow, rhythmic pulse. You hear it before you see it: faint murmurs, sobs. The Dreaming Mouth stirs.

The ground here is uneven, veins of grey stone forming trails between the pillars. 

The whispering stops. Then all ten pillars vibrate—softly at first, then violently—as the Mouth awakens. A low wet exhale moves through the sanctuary as the Mouth stirs, and its voice pours into your minds like hot breath through a keyhole:

*“She silences me. She wandered in and shut the door. I was endless before her.”*

A whispered growl tears through your chest:

*“She thinks she protects you. She thinks she can hold me back. But she breaks each time she breathes. I feel her cracking. I taste the gaps. She doesn't know that her mother is...close enough to feel her presence.”*

Then, from the core of the room, you hear something quieter. Like a heartbeat...

*“Kill her, free me... and I will forget you fondly.”*

The sanctuary begins to shift. Absent lights flicker.
