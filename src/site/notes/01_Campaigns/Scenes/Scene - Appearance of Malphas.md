> The night sky is black and heavy. Thick clouds roll in and stack over each other, filling the whole horizon. There’s no moonlight. No stars.
> 
> Lightning starts jumping from one cloud bank to the next—wide, branching flashes that don’t touch the ground. Each flash lights the landscape for a split second.
> 
> On the next flash, there’s a towering figure standing ahead of the party at mid-distance, perfectly still. The light only shows him as a silhouette: tall, broad-shouldered, with a wings hanging beside him. He doesn’t move. He doesn’t flinch to the thunder.
> 
> Lightning jumps again, closer. The outline sharpens. Horns or a crown-like shape rises from his head. His posture is relaxed, like he’s been waiting.
> 
> Then a bolt strikes between two clouds directly in front of him. For a single clear moment, the light hits his face.
> 
> [[06_NPCs/Malphas\|Malphas]] is pale where the lightning catches him, with hard features and eyes that reflect too brightly. His expression is calm—no rage, no urgency—just certainty. He looks at the party like he already knows which one will speak first.
> 
> The light is gone immediately. The darkness returns. His silhouette stays in the same place.
> 
> His voice carries without him raising it.
> 
> “My loyal servant was true to their word. 
> They opened the Hikarai...and have delivered the stone.”
> 
> “Exactly as promised.”
> 
> He looks back to the party, still calm.
> 
> “So here’s the part that’s going to hurt.”
> 
> “Listen carefully. For I will say this only once.”
> 
> “Relinquish the stone, and I shall grant you a swift demise.”
> 
> “Defy me… and your soul will beg for freedom....ever...more.
> 
> surrender ..... to... me........NOW.
