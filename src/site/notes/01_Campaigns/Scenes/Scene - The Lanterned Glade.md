> The starlight barely scratches through the canopy, pooling in silver streaks across the moss. The smell of damp earth and pine sap hangs thick in the air. Somewhere deeper in the forest, a lone nightbird calls, then stops—as if it thought better of it.
> You catch the flicker of a hooded lantern through the trees. Its glow sways gently, rising and falling with the footsteps of the figure carrying it. When you step closer, the hood lifts just enough to reveal a dark-cloaked woman. 
> She doesn’t greet you; instead, she presses a gloved finger to her lips and leads you into a shallow glade ringed with leaning oaks. The lantern’s light is swallowed by the shadows, the circle of safety uncomfortably small.

<font color="#a5a5a5">*When she finally speaks, her voice is taut. She introduces herself as Liora, a member of the Oasis High Civil Assembly. Instead of wearing Civil Assembly silks, she has traded them for a dark riding cloak, the hem muddied from travel.*</font>

>The party follows her
> 	You have followed a strange woman into the dark woods. You are as brave as I had hoped.

> I know you're pursuing Velura. My mole on the inside tells me Varn Drest sold Velura Elaris to the Sanctifiers.”   
> “I’m pushing for her release through the Assembly, but every step forward costs me favors I cannot replace. The Assembly doesn't believe that Drest has imprisoned a Sorceress from [[02_World/Vis’Avae\|Vis’Avae]]. He's concealing her for some reason. The Civil Assembly keep dismissing me and they’ll bury this if I can’t bring something that forces their hand. Evidence that can’t be denied. Or pressure they can’t ignore. I think Drest is on to me.”

A gust rattles the leaves overhead, and for a moment, her gaze darts past you into the dark, checking if you were followed.

> “I cannot be seen with you in the city, nor in Jade. Too many eyes. If you’re willing to help, I’ll guide you to what I know—but we’ll need to keep our movements… untraceable.”

She exhales slowly, then reaches into the folds of her cloak and withdraws a parchment bound with twine. The paper is creased, the red wax seal pressed slightly off-center.

> *She produces a folded page bound with twine, then tucks it away again before you can reach for it.* 
> “This is a **[[Items/Provisional Writ of Entry\|Provisional Writ of Entry]]**, in the Countess’s name. It is… not entirely official. The less anyone studies it, the better for all of us.”

She doesn’t release the parchment right away. [She reveals intel from her two spies on the inside. One hasn't been responding. Still sends info.]

> “Listen closely. Velura’s cell is on the sixth floor, central corridor, guarded by Commander Velexia and two knights. Velexia is powerful AND disciplined — she won’t be swayed by lies. If you can convince her that moving Velura serves the Countess directly, she may cooperate but you'll need to handle Drest separately. Failing that… you’ll need to distract her and the guards or get them away from the floor entirely before you break into the cell...expect a response if you do so. Drest will be a whole other problem.”

Liora’s voice drops even lower.

> “There are two separate stairwells on the 4th floor, northern and southern. The northern one connects Velexia and Drest's quarters on the 4th floor to Drest's office and his meeting room on the 5th. The Southern stairwell is a guarded stairway from Velura. The key is usually on Velexia’s planning table. Take it and get her out before the watch rotation — midnight is your best chance...when most guards are sleeping. Distract the remaining guards.”

Her gaze fixes on you with quiet intensity as she finally presses the writ into your hand.

> “The writ of entry should open the Stronghold’s doors. Or get you arrested. The safest way to get her to Vis'Avae is with secret transport from Ahrown. Once your out, seek the capital city and remember — if she vanishes without trace, the Civil Assembly can’t tie it to either of us.”

The lantern light catches the faintest tremor in her hand before she turns toward the dark trees.

> “We have maybe 3 days. No more. The guards are fierce but stupid. Make friends, play along.”

Liora intention:  She intends for the party to **expose Velura’s illegal detainment**, hoping it will **politically destroy Varn Drest** and destabilize the Stronghold so the Assembly can **install a less Sanctifier-aligned leader.**
