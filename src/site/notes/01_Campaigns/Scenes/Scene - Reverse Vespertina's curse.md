> It began as a hum; faint at first, like the vibration of distant thunder. In the still hour between night and dawn, Vespertina’s stirred in her slumber and her eyes fluttered open. From the bedside chest came a magnetic pull, as though she were being summoned. 
> 
> The hum grew louder, becoming a whisper, then a chant without words. She reached out. Her fingers trembled as they brushed the worn leather cover of The Profane Word. The moment her skin met it, the whisper spoke her name. “Vespertina…” 
> 
> A flash tore through the room. White, gold, and violet, so blinding she thought for an instant she had died. Her head snapped upward, eyes rolling back as her body lifted from her knees. Light filled her veins, racing through every scar left of her curse. She saw everything at once. Not as memory, but as truth. 
> 
> Bahamut’s hand upon her the day of her curse, his golden radiance shielding her soul from the killer’s touch. The faint shimmer of his grace had lingered in her all these years — the reason the curse had never consumed her. 
> 
> In the same flash, but crimson now, she saw her great-great-grandfather, kneeling before Asmodeus, the bargain written in his blood. A pact that twisted their line forever, forging a debt that bound even the innocent. 
> 
> And beyond them all — she saw Nerull, ancient and still, meditating in a void of nothingness as his quill carved the Book of the Profane Word into being. Ink that bled like ichor, letters that writhed and screamed as they formed. 
> 
> She opened her eyes, somehow on her knees by the chest as though she had never moved. The Book lay open in her lap now, the first page slowly turning. She reads the first lines aloud, her voice low and somehow accompaniedby shadow: 
> 
> “True evil is a festering thing. It lies dormant in every person’s heart, its whisper a vile temptation towards a dark power. That whisper is the Profane Word. And bound within the pages of this twisted manuscript, that promised power is yours for the taking.” 
> 
> When the last word left her lips, silence fell... thick, absolute. Her heart pounded with the weight of understanding and what she knew must come next. She was not merely born of contradiction, she was forged from it. Touched by both heaven and hell, it was only she who could bear this burden. She whispered, trembling yet resolute: 
> 
> “If this power must be taken then it is mine to redeem in truth... not as dominion but as deliverance. Death shall bow not to malice, but to mercy. When the abyss calls to me I shall not answer as its servant but as its reckoning. 
> 
> I bind myself to the Profane Word to command its silence... To unwrite death itself where mercy demands it.” The Book shuddered. A blank page turned of its own accord. Violet light spilled from the parchment, and golden letters began to form — words written not by Nerull, but by Vespertina herself. 
> 
> The script glowed, alive, shifting between languages of gods and ghosts. 
> 
> “Here begins the Reclamation of Death.” 
> 
> She exhaled — trembling, radiant, infinite — and the room fell silent once again. For as she rose, as written in the book... she began to change.
