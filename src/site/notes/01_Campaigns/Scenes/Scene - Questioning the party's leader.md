Jade Stronghold welcomes you in the name of Oasis. You are free to pursue the duty entrusted to you. Feel free to mingle where it is fitting and to share our halls as guests. We will offer you quarters on the 5th floor. Accessed via the southern stairwell. Only take care not to step into matters that belong solely to the garrison.

You arrive under writ, yes, but Oasis often writes with one hand and erases with the other. Oasis saw fit to send you here on their behalf. Tell me—what _exactly_ have they entrusted you to accomplish?”
