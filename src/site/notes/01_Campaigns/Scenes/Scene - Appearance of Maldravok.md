A man appears on a flat stone in the center, elbows on his knees, head bowed. No torch, no camp, no sign he’s been living here—just him. His clothes are simple, worn to colorless cloth.

When he speaks, it’s quiet but carries through the whole space.

> “So you made it through.”

He doesn’t look up right away. When he does, his eyes are the color of slate, too pale for a human. They linger on each of them—measuring, not threatening.

> “You’ve come a long way. Through tests....Not just through the Tree. Through yourselves.”

He says it plainly, like explaining a fact no one should have missed.

A beat of silence follows before he adds,

> “I suppose your here to hide something...if from Nerull...you'll be disappointed. He knows this place.”

He stands, and something about the motion is wrong—too smooth, too heavy for his size. His back straightens, his neck rolling like someone figuring out how to move in their own skin. Dust shakes from the ceiling.

When he exhales, the air around you moves.  

The man’s shape splits along the shoulders. Cloth drops to the ground. Beneath it, scales catch the low light like wet stone. Wings unfurl once, slow and stiff, stretching the width of the chamber.

The same voice, calm and even, follows from above.

> “Leave what you came to hide; as long as I breathe...it will never leave this chamber.”
