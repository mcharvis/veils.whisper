They didn’t welcome her—they used her. Sanctifier Halric led the ritual. They believed her mind held buried trauma they could extract and store, like all the others. But when they opened her thoughts, something reached back.

Three priests bled from the eyes and forgot their own names. One walked into the forest and was never seen again. The Mouth, long dormant, pulsed beneath the stone. They locked her in a cell that night and never spoke of it again.

| A circular ritual chamber below the church. Candles flicker with unnatural stillness. In the center sits a girl, Miren. She’s barefoot, thin, her dress frayed. Her hands tremble in her lap. Four Sanctifiers stand around her, gripping glowing iron chains etched with runes. |

Sanctifier Halric (measured):  
> *"Her mind is a maze of scars. If we extract the worst of it, she may sleep. And so might the Mouth."*

Sanctifier Yllin (whispering):  
> *"She’s just a child. Are we sure about this? She hasn’t spoken since she escaped from the asylum."*

Sanctifier Halric:  
> *"She doesn’t need a voice. Can’t you hear her screams…in your mind?"*

*The chains begin to hum. Miren flinches. Her lips move, but no sound comes out. A low vibration fills the room.*

Sanctifier Seraphene:  
> *"Something’s wrong. Her memories aren’t yielding. They’re reaching...toward us."*

*Suddenly, the candles blow out. The walls groan. One priest falls to his knees, blood pouring from his nose and eyes.* 

Sanctifier Jornis (gasping):  
> *"She’s not showing us pain…she’s feeding it to us!"*

*Another priest stumbles back, muttering: “Who am I? What name—” before collapsing.]*

Sanctifier Maelth:  
> *"Shit, we didn’t open her mind. We opened…a door."*

*The ground below pulses once—deep, alive. The Dreaming Mouth, long sealed beneath the church, stirs.*

Sanctifier Halric (quiet, horrified):  
> *"We were wrong. Gods forgive us. She’s not a wound to bind…she’s what was bound."*

*Miren begins to cry silently. Her tears float upward. She looks at no one, but all feel seen.*

Sanctifier Seraphene (whispers):  
> *"Fools! She begged you not to look... and you looked anyway. This will be the end of us. Mark my words."*

*One Sanctifier turns and walks away—slow, vacant. He is never seen again.* 

Sanctifier Halric (coldly):  
> "Seal her in. No more rituals. No more words. We protect the world from her…her and the beast."

| The memory fades. The last image is Miren, alone behind bars in the dark, eyes still glowing faintly as she wraps her arms around herself and disappears into shadow. The beast calms. |
