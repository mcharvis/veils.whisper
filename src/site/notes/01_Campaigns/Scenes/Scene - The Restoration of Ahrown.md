The trek began at dawn. King Aldenor’s banners, long thought lost beneath the black rain of Ahrown’s fall after King Aldenor overthrew [[06_NPCs/Queen Vaeloria, The Hollow\|Queen Vaeloria, The Hollow]], unfurled once more over the horizon. His procession carved through the desolation between the ruined capital and its outskirt city, Oasis—a march of skeletal honor guards, weary knights, and the faint shimmer of elven light clinging to old armor. The people of Oasis gathered in silence as the Mad King returned—not as a specter, but as a monarch reborn.

Behind him rode **Princess Vespertina**, his living daughter and sole heir to the Kingdom of Ahrown of Elarith of Carceri and the Kingdom of Elarion in the Material Realm. Her presence was the quiet answer to the unease that rippled through the crowd. For all his infamy, King Aldenor had not returned alone. The bloodline had survived.

Upon reunion with his daughter, madness began to wash away from the fallen King and he named Vespertina as princess of Ahrown and swore to reclaim Ahrown not as a kingdom of drow and decay, but as a realm of elven nobility restored to its former grace.

But restoration rarely comes without blood.  The **House of Vaer-Lorne**, once the most powerful noble house in Oasis, was stripped of title and privilege. Aldenor’s decree cited “no confidence and dereliction of duty.” Their banners were torn from the hall and cast into the fire pit of the court. The flames hissed blue—the mark of elven sorcery breaking lineage oaths.

To replace their absent strength, Aldenor elevated **Commander Velexia** to **High Marshal**. Once a battlefield commander, now the supreme hand of military order, Velexia was granted authority over Ahrown’s armies and its protectorate cities. Her reputation for loyalty and precision made her both feared and respected.

The reshaping of power continued in silence. **Captain Rel Thorn** previously in command of Oasis was reassigned to lead a recon division whose captain had been killed in the border wars in the [[Realm of Elethon\|Realm of Elethon]]. Aldenor’s message was clear: service would be rewarded, failure would be recycled.

And then there was the matter of **Councilor Varn Drest**.  
The man who once whispered policy into royal ears found himself standing before the throne without a voice. Aldenor’s judgment was not theatrical; it was clinical. Drest’s name was stricken from the council registry, his seat left empty. “Vacancy,” Aldenor said, “is preferable to rot.”

By dusk, the city of Oasis had changed hands without a single blade drawn. The old noble court was gone, the banners repainted, and the people stood beneath a rule they could neither love nor resist.

When night fell, Aldenor stood on the balcony of the royal manor, the stars casting silver across his pale face. Vespertina stood beside him, silent. The king’s voice carried over the courtyard like the echo of something ancient and unyielding.

“Let the dead rest beneath the earth,” he said. “And let the living rise to reclaim what is ours.”

In that moment, Oasis was no longer a city of corruption—it was the manicured hand of a new Ahrown.
