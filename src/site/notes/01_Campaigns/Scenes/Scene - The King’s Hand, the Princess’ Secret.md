Velexia sensed the march before she saw it—the rhythm of discipline, the echo of order thought dead.. When the banners of Ahrown emerged through the fog, her hand fell to the hilt out of habit, not fear. As the procession rode through Oasis, Aldenor took the lead—his crown restored, his armor dulled by time—yet no madness shadowed his gaze. His knights parted, and through their ranks rode a figure she did not know: slender, radiant, unmistakably royal. Whispers rippled through the crowd like a shiver. "The Mad King has found his heir." 

Inside, the halls were thick with smoke and politics. House Vaer-Lorne, once untouchable, now erased. Velexia stood at attention, helm beneath her arm, eyes steady as the King entered the court. “Commander Velexia,” he said. “Kneel before your King.” Her armor creaked as she sank to one knee. “You have served when others fled. You have kept discipline where chaos reigned. By my decree, you are henceforth High Marshal of Ahrown, Protector of Oasis, my hand of war.” 

She bowed her head—until another voice spoke. Soft. Familiar. “Rise.” She looked up. 

'The princess—the stranger from the road—stood before her, a brooch gleaming in her hands: gold and violet, shaped like a dragon’s eye. Vespertina adorned it to her chestplate, and for a heartbeat her world stopped. The violet of her eyes; the faint shimmer of gold at their edges. Confusion but recognition. It was Vespertina. The one she had trusted without knowing why. The one who not only helped save her life but one of her most secret possessions. They did not speak. They didn’t need to. 

Later that eve, Thornhold still reeked of incense and ceremony. Velexia sat alone in her quarters, the marshal’s sigil gleaming faintly on the armor stand beside her bed; her hair unbound—a rare surrender. A knock—three measured raps, soft but deliberate. 

“Enter,” she said. 
Candlelight spilled across silver hair. 

“Marshall,” Vespertina said, her voice steady but softer than Velexia remembered. Velexia rose. “Your … Highness.” The title felt foreign. 

“I didn’t expect you to know me," Vespertina said. 
“I didn’t,” Velexia admitted. “Not at first.” Vespertina stepped closer, the faintest scents of ozone and lavender following her. “You must know, the last time we spoke, I ...palms open and looks down... wasn’t myself. And there’s much you deserve to understand.” 

She told her everything—of the curse, the Mad King, the truth between worlds. Velexia studied her. “And now you wear the crown,” she said quietly. “A princess in two worlds.” Vespertina lowered her gaze. “I never meant to deceive you.” “I don’t think you could,” Velexia murmured. “Even if you tried.” Vespertina’s eyes drifted, taking her in. Without armor, Velexia seemed both smaller and indomitable—stripped down to her arming doublet, the fabric worn thin from years of battle. Candlelight traced countless scars beneath: pale slashes along her arms, the crescent curve of a strange burn at her ribs, many wounds still healing from the siege. 

Vespertina’s breath caught. Before she realized it, her hand lifted, brushing one faint line along Velexia’s arm. “Does it hurt?” she asked softly. Velexia’s eyes met hers. “Only when I think about how I got them.” The air between them grew alive. Then Velexia’s hand rose, slow and uncertain, fingertips coming to rest against the faint golden shimmer at Vespertina’s collarbone—the remnants of her curse. “I was going to ask you the same thing,” she said. The light pulsed beneath her touch, gold meeting pale silver. Neither moved. Vespertina whispered, “No one has ever touched me before.” Velexia’s voice came low, bearing the grit of command yet laced with the softness of a woman surrendered to call she could no longer refuse. “Then I’m honored to be the first.” 

In that breath, gravity remembered them, the space between them vanishing in a collision of strength and solace. When their lips met, it was a silence made sacred, the brief unmaking of two lives built on discipline and duty. The glow beneath Vespertina’s skin flared—her scaled scars lighting like dawn through clouds. Velexia felt the hum travel through her fingertips, through her ribs, through the part of her that knew she’d just crossed a line she could never uncross. When they parted, her breath came unsteady. “Your Highness… Forgive me. I shouldn’t have. Please. This never happened.” 

Vespertina’s smile was faint, defiant. She placed her hand underneath Velexia’s jaw, holding her there. Vespertina leaned in again, her violet gaze burning into Velexia’s eyes – her lips grazing Velexia’s as she breathed against them.... “Then you shall have to be the one who forgets.”
