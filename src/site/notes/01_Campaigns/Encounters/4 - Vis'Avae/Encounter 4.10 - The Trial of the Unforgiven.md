**Setting:**  

The seance completes. The candles erupt inward—heat and air rushing in to fill the room. 
Nebula Video
The last candle sputters and the room exhales a slow breath of heat.  
Smoke drifts up to the ceiling, then falls like water, in a white curtain of smoke within the room.

The sorceresses gesture to walk into curtain. The party finds themselves on a patch of purple feygrass looking out over the sea. Fae trees rise from the ashen ground, equidistant in a ring around the Mosaic Die...each one a different hue: starlit violet, dew-silver blue, rose-amber blush, verdant gold, hollow white, and thorn-green black. **[[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]]**—barefoot, bronze-skinned, her eyes soft with the glow of dawn appears amongst the stars

> Six candles, six trials, six souls. But who offered the 6th candle?! Maeve’s soul had fallen to Nerull long ago. She would never light her own candle now. So...which sorceress has taken her place?”
 
She looks toward **Vespertina**, recognition dawning.  

> “It would seem that my brother's shadow reaches farther than I feared. 
> Your defiance of [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]] has not gone unnoticed. [[05_Player Characters/Vespertina\|Vespertina]], to fight the hunger of death with a living heart… is no small courage. For most mortals...it's a fool's errand to challenge Nerull. 
> 
> So, it would seem that Xaphan has trusted...mortals..."   

Tisiphone’s voice lowers, certain now.

> “I know why you’ve come.”  
> “You seek the shard [[05_Player Characters/Inactive/Xaphan\|Xaphan]] left in my keeping—a fragment of the [[Items/Magical/Death-Wrought Mosaic\|Death-Wrought Mosaic]].”  

> Who has the first piece? 

> “[[05_Player Characters/Squeaks\|Squeaks]]...If you mean to claim it, you must prove yourself worthy of what it can do.”

She reaches up and tickles the starlight surrounding her.

> “The [[Death-Wrought Mosaic \|Death-Wrought Mosaic ]]binds the hands of Nerull, Squeaks” she says softly. "It manipulates the present...determines the future. The roll of fate can be cruel, but Xaphan trusts you to wield it. However, I don't know you....so, one must show me that they can accept one's destiny.”

### **Tisiphone’s Test – The Six Veils of Fate**

[[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]] raises her hand and teases the starlight around her.

> “The Mosaic shapes destiny, but destiny does not choose itself alone. Many times, we share a guided path...with others.
> Another soul is bound to your path. The one will guide you through the Veil to Xaphan. 
> I will help you find your destiny. But if you seek to cross the Veil, you must trust Hecate’s wisdom. And [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Nyx\|Nyx]]… what can I say of my cruel sister? She always finds joy in the suffering of gods. If you choose to exit Elarith, if it’s vengeance on [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]] you seek… I suspect Nyx would take great pleasure in helping you do it.

Tisiphone lifts curtains of dense fog that appear between the trees. She watches the veils ripple with silhouettes.

> “The space beyond the Veil lies the infinite beginning of nothing — where memory, love, and self are ground to dust beneath the weight of eternity. The living do not simply cross it...if they wish to return.”  

> “When you cross the Veil, you will not go as flesh,” she says. “You will be reduced — thought without form, breath without sound. A shadow of yourself. Your soul...”
> “That is what we call a _whisp_ — a soul stripped of its weight. You will know yourself, you will feel your strength, but a soul split from from its body is fragile.”
> “In that state, you cannot find your way. The Veil does not allow the lost to wander. ”
> “The one that fate chooses will not simply lead you across the veil...a Whisper allows your soul to traverse  with guidance” she says.  

> “Without a Whisper, you will not find death waiting for you — you will find _nothing._ A silence so vast it consumes the very idea that you, or anything bound to you ever existed. your name, your memories, your faith, your blood, the faces you love, the ones who would mourn you, every deed, every sin, every trace you ever left upon the world — 
> “And still, to find Xaphan and avoid nothingness, you must walk it. That is why you need a Whisper.”

She gestures toward the six veils, each flickering in fey color.

> “You will need such a soul to guide you into this domain. Trust the role/roll of fate to choose who will walk beside you against the God of Death against my brother. Allow fate to choose your Whisper...and trust it's wisdom.”

Roll Death-Wrought Mosaic.

Chosen: [[01_Campaigns/Scenes/Scene - The Veil's Whisper\|Scene - The Veil's Whisper]]

> “So fate has spoken and The Veil's Whisper is [[The Scarlet Raven\|The Scarlet Raven]].”

She lifts her hand toward the sky, fingers closing around one of the stars. When she lowers her hand, the star has hardened into a cube of glass the size of a large pebble — the **shard**. 

> “The [[Items/Magical/Death-Wrought Mosaic\|Death-Wrought Mosaic]] belongs to [[05_Player Characters/Inactive/Xaphan\|Xaphan]] and is safe with me...but not with you.” she says. "Once beyond the Veil, you must hide it a place beyond the grasp of Nerull."

> “Now...Turn, and gaze upon[[02_World/The Pedronian Empire\|The Pedronian Empire]].”

The sea before you folds away, showing a stretch of burning cities. 

> “Villages lie in pieces, fields burned to dust. Small fires crawl through the ruins where armies have passed. These were once the clans united under [[06_NPCs/Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame\|Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame]],” she says quietly. “Now they fight each other for...nothing.”
 
Her gaze fixes on **Renzo Morokami.**

> “Renzo Morokami, of [[The House Takaren\|The House Takaren]]...your blood ties you to them. The House Takaren once joined the clans that followed [[06_NPCs/Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame\|Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame]]. You’re the last of that line who still honors the old ways. The others have forgotten what they fought for. Your path leads north” she says. “To **[[The Hikarai\|The Hikarai]] (hee-KAH-rye)**—a crystallum built to hold the [[Items/The Tsukaru\|The Tsukaru]] (tsoo-KAH-roo), A sacred gemstone that bestows power unto the [[Crown of the Quiet Sovereign\|Crown of the Quiet Sovereign]].”


> “But the stone is inaccessible. The clans that once protected the The Hikarai have turned on each other...on themselves. Without them, the Tsukaru will remain lost.”

> “To reach the Tsukaru, you’ll need to bring those clans back together. Six pagodas mark their lands. When all six stand under one banner again, the path to **The Hikarai** will be opened.”

> “Go north. Find the pagodas. Reunite the clans. When the **The Hikarai** shines again, it will lead you to the gemstone—and to Xaphan.”
