### **Daytime: 0600â€“2200**

- **Conversion:** 1 real-world hour = 16 in-game daytime hours.
    
- **Activity Style:** Social interaction, planning, recon, moving openly between areas (but at risk).
    
- **Guard State:** On alert, patrols frequent, stealth checks at disadvantage.

### **Nighttime: 2200â€“0600**

- **Task-Based System:**  
    Instead of fixed hours, the night is broken into **Task Segments**. Each player may attempt **1 Major Task per night**, plus as many **Minor Tasks** as they can afford before suspicion rises.
    
- **Exhaustion:** Each full night without sleep = **1 [[00_GM Tools/Homebrew rules/Exhaustion\|Exhaustion]] level**.
    
    - A 2â€“3 hour nap during the day cancels _that nightâ€™s_ exhaustion penalty, but doesnâ€™t heal existing exhaustion.
        
- **Stealth Priority:** This is the main infiltration window.

## ðŸŽ² **Task Costs (Nighttime)**

- **Minor Task (Quick, 10â€“30 min in fiction):**
    
    - Peek into a room, pick a simple lock, quick exchange with a prisoner, scout a corridor.
        
    - Low risk (stealth check only if near a patrol).
        
- **Standard Task (1â€“2 hrs in fiction):**
    
    - Thoroughly search a room, pick a complex lock, silently take out a guard, smuggle an item.
        
    - Requires Stealth check; failure â†’ 1 Alert Point.
        
- **Major Task (3â€“4 hrs in fiction):**
    
    - Prisoner extraction, planting evidence, forging documents, disabling a mechanism, large-scale sabotage.
        
    - Each player may only attempt **1 Major Task per night**.
        
    - Always requires Stealth check; failure â†’ 2 Alert Points.

## ðŸ‘€ **Detection / Alert Points**

- **Alert Point = suspicion raised**.
    
- Gain Alert Points from failed Stealth, loud actions, or accumulating too many tasks at once.
    
- **At 3 Points:** Guard suspicion (extra patrols, disadvantage on Stealth until patrols are evaded).
    
- **At 5 Points:** Lockdown (bells rung, curfews, fortified choke points, all Stealth checks at disadvantage).

## ðŸ”„ **How It Plays**

- **Day Phase (1 hr real = 16 hrs game):** Recon, talk, plan, nap, or risk moving about.
    
- **Night Phase (Task-based):** Players choose tasks to attempt; you resolve them sequentially. Once everyoneâ€™s done their Major Task, the night ends.
    
- **Sleep Debt:** Players decide whether to rest (skip a night) or push on (risk exhaustion).
