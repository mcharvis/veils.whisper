**Ya’a Thalor & the Sanctifiers**

- _What happened at Ya’a Thalor?_ — The Sanctifiers… we were ambushed by zombies. They were clever, too clever. We weren’t ready. Most of us died—some ran. Us higher priests, we were supposed to…kill ourselves in the crypts. We thought the truth about the children would come out. I swear, I never wanted it to go that far.
    
- _Why did the Sanctifiers experiment on children?_ — It wasn’t my idea! They said children’s minds bent easier to the rituals. That they could hold the weight of the Dreaming Mouth better than adults. It worked, at least until Miren… until she came. Then it all fell apart.

**Miren & Velura**

- _What happened to Miren?_ — She was just a child—a student? inmate? at the Whispering Asylum. I don't know much about that place since it shut down. She crawled out through a tunnel to the lowest level, but we caught her. We kept her under the church, used her mind to quiet the Dreaming Mouth. Samantha's spells allowed that. The mind chains. I didn’t want to—Halric made us.

**Oasis & Jade Stronghold**

- _Why does the Stronghold keep you alive?_ — Because they’re afraid. They know if I die, the truth about the Sanctifiers might rot away with me. So they keep me here—poke at me, ask about my faith, my leaders. I’m not a man anymore, I’m leverage. They say they are trying to find all of us.
 
**About Himself**

- _Why didn’t you join the suicide pact?_ — I—I ran. I was terrified. The zombies came in a flood, and I bolted. I wish I could say I fought, but I didn’t. I’ll die remembered as a coward… because I am. But at least Halric is gone. He's way more terrifying than Velexia...and that woman is every nightmare you've ever had.
    
- _What do you regret most?_ — Opening Miren’s mind. Helping Halric force her into that… thing. I told myself I had no choice, that I was just following orders, but that’s a lie I can’t swallow anymore.
    
- _Why should we trust you?_ — You shouldn’t. I don’t deserve trust. I don’t even deserve breath. If you kill me here, it’ll be justice. But they are going to use me as long as they can to find and kill Sanctifiers.
