## Introduction

> **Prepare to die.**
> 
> At Ya’a Thalor, the amulet of the Inescapable Room allowed access to the Lower Sanctuary, where the Dreaming Mouth rose from its slumber—only to be cut down in Renzo’s Ice Knife. You emerged with gold, maps, and an enchanted key, but more: a message. Seren of the Pale Flame stepped from shadow, speaking of Tisiphone and the Bellum Crystallum, of the price of safe passage that requires a visit with the Mad King of Ahrown.
> Your path turned to blood. Following the footprints of Sanctifier Samantha Virelle, you saw her grief tear Magda’s soul apart within the dining room of the Whispering Asylum. And in the forest, Liora came by lanternlight. She placed a forged writ in your hands hoping it wouldn't get you arrested. Her warning was plain: Velura was sold to the Sanctifiers by Councilor Drest. “Bring evidence,” she urged. “About three days, or the truth is buried.”
> Within, the Stronghold revealed more lies than truth—Varian’s false vows, Kovinar’s quiet salvations, whispers of Velexia’s loneliness, and Drest’s corruption at the core. You silently gathered fragments: burned reports, Sanctifier relics, ledgers of betrayal, and the damning truth that Halric lives.
> The second day, shadows moved. While Squeaks shared combat tactics with Velexia, you found proof enough to ruin Drest. On the sixth floor, Velura’s cell was opened with a key, not by theft, but by Velexia’s hopeful trust in Vespertina after growing suspicious of Drest. In preparation for extraction, Varian slipped into the forest before Vespertina’s fire ball stuck the Stronghold spirit...exploding the eastern wall apart, a blast seen as far as Ahrown. And then—the horns. Sanctifiers came in force, masked and armed, clawing at the Stronghold’s stone. 
> Grappling hooks flew. Horns bellowed. The Stronghold fell into siege. And as the portal slammed behind you, Velura whispered: “They’ve come for me. Let’s go.” The Cinderflare portal closed, silently transporting you back to the Whispering Asylum to reunite a mother and her daughter...a luxury Sanctifier Samantha Virelle will never experience.
> When the smoke cleared, the Stronghold stood hollowed. Its halls ran with ash and blood. Velexia lay on the cobblestone...clinging to life. Varn Drest had already slipped into shadow. 
> Only a few hearts still beat outside the tower. And in the silence, opportunists stirred. Somewhere beyond the smoke, eyes measured the fallen not as victims, but as resources—bodies waiting to be claimed.
> 
> You know you'll survive if you're prepared to die.

## Summary

> Varian staggered out of [[The Evergrowing Forest\|The Evergrowing Forest]] at dawn, his cloak heavy with dew and his eyes hollow from walking through the night. When he reached [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]], he found the party gathered with grim faces and darker news. Survivors clung to life—[[06_NPCs/Commander Velexia\|Commander Velexia]], [[06_NPCs/Thorne Drevic\|Thorne Drevic]], [[06_NPCs/Kaelin Vetch\|Kaelin Vetch]], three guards (Jeb, Tesk, and Queng, each torn and bloodied), and the goblin cook, Pop, still somehow clutching his apron like a badge of survival.
> It was [[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|Velura Elaris]] who gave them the truth that bound past, present, and the path ahead. She spoke of her daughter, [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]], and her desire to take her to [[02_World/Vis’Avae\|Vis’Avae]]. There, Velura said, dwelled [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]], one of Nerull’s abandoned sisters. She told them of the three demi-goddesses—[[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]], [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Hecate\|Hecate]], and [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Nyx\|Nyx]]—betrayed in Nerull’s ascension to godhood, sacrificed so he could clutch power. Velura’s warning was sharp: approach each of these forsaken sisters with caution, for they are not simply relics of the past but living powers, twisted and watchful.
> With little choice, the party left [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]] through its basement and stepped into the portal that opened beneath [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]]. They found a mimic but turned away rather than waste strength. Removing the cover of the ancient well, they descended into the cavern. [[05_Player Characters/Squeaks\|Squeaks]], [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]], and [[05_Player Characters/Renzo\|Renzo]] stretched a massive root across a thirty-five-foot drop while half a dozen giant spiders waited hungrily below. A well-placed arrow and rope let them haul gold into their packs—1,150 pieces and a single white pearl, gleaming like an eye in the dark.
> They emerged at [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]], its western third-floor wall and eastern fifth-floor wall blasted away. Outside, buried in rubble, lay [[06_NPCs/Commander Velexia\|Commander Velexia]], bleeding out beside [[06_NPCs/Kaelin Vetch\|Kaelin Vetch]] and [[06_NPCs/Thorne Drevic\|Thorne Drevic]]. Velexia’s eyes snapped open at the sight of [[05_Player Characters/Vespertina\|Vespertina]] and [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]], surprise breaking into a weak smile.
> _"You… by the gods, it’s you."_ Her voice wavered, but the relief in it was sharper than steel. Blood streaked her gauntlet as she coughed. _"Of all the liars in Oasis, you were the ones I chose to trust… I knew your words in the hall were false, but I prayed your lies were for Drest, not me. Velura should never have been caged. I had no way left to fight his corruption clean, so I gambled on you. Tell me—was I wrong?"_
> [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]] knelt and renewed life back into her and the others, while [[05_Player Characters/Squeaks\|Squeaks]] and [[05_Player Characters/Vespertina\|Vespertina]] scoured the stronghold. Vespertina found Velexia’s grand ballgown but her dagger was missing; worse, she heard faint muttering through a wall about “bodies.”
> Outside, the truth revealed itself. Two necromancers—[[Vex Varoth\|Vex Varoth]] and his apprentice [[Vex Lazriel\|Vex Lazriel]]—stood surveying the dead. Varoth’s grin was hungry. _"So many. Strong shoulders, unbroken spines… these will walk well. Off you go, strangers. I have claimed everything here."_
> The party refused. Battle erupted. Spells crackled, corpses rose, rubble fell. While some dug for healing potions, others dragged the necromancers into the fray. [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]], in her dream state, loomed like a nightmare over Varoth, rattling his soul. Kovinar hurled him from the third-floor ledge. Velexia, given just enough potion to stand, downed another and returned to battle with the fury of a reborn knight. Together, they cut down the necromancers.
> Looting their bodies revealed the cursed and rare [[Items/Staff of the Corpsefield\|Staff of the Corpsefield]] and the [[Items/Blade of Hollow Triumph\|Blade of Hollow Triumph]]. Among the wreckage of the stronghold, they found +1 weapons but nothing much better. Velura and Miren chose to stay behind, reuniting at the asylum rather than press on to [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Oasis\|Oasis]], with the hope the party would collect them later on their way to [[02_World/Vis’Avae\|Vis’Avae]]. [[06_NPCs/Kaelin Vetch\|Kaelin Vetch]] slipped away to deliver intelligence to [[06_NPCs/Liora\|Liora]] under Kovinar’s command.
> At last, they reached Oasis—a bustling village humming with shadows beneath its surface. [[06_NPCs/Commander Velexia\|Commander Velexia]] led them straight to [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Thornhold Keep\|Thornhold Keep]], where she emerged later at the side of the towering [[06_NPCs/Captain Rel Thorn\|Captain Rel Thorn]].
> Velexia’s voice carried authority, but there was warmth in it too. *“This party showed me loyalty beyond coin. Kovinar, a leader born of fire and faith. Vespertina, who trusted when none else would. Squeaks, a fearless tactician. Renzo, unbending in loyalty. And Varian, who has faced odds no one should survive.”*
> Rel Thorn gave them the weight of his gratitude. *“Oasis owes you breath. But beneath the streets, the rot deepens. Drest and the [[04_Organizations/Pale Flame\|Pale Flame]] plot. They have stolen sketches of the [[Items/Needle of Accord\|Needle of Accord]]—a weapon not meant to pierce armor, but alliances. If finished, it will turn kingdoms against each other. Infiltrate the [[Sanctum of Withered Light\|Sanctum of Withered Light]]. Take back the plans. But your ties to Oasis must remain unseen.”*
> When Kovinar presented [[Items/Drest’s letter\|the letter Drest gave him]], Thorn resealed it, granting Kovinar the guise of an agent within the Sanctum.
> Outside, Vespertina handed Velexia her lost ballgown in silence. Velexia’s eyes welled, unguarded and vulnerable, a secret no one else would believe. She turned away quickly, but trust lingered between them like a flame refusing to die.
> The party spread into Oasis. At [[The Crooked Anvil\|The Crooked Anvil]], Kovinar forged Squeaks a +1 dagger while the blacksmith, [[06_NPCs/Bruma Anvil-Eye\|Bruma Anvil-Eye]], told him the [[Items/Blade of Hollow Triumph\|Blade of Hollow Triumph]] bore elven craft from [[Ahrown, Kingdom of Elves\|Ahrown, Kingdom of Elves]]. Kovinar remembered then—the zombies that ambushed Jade Stronghold at [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]] had been elves.
> Meanwhile, Varian and Renzo rested at [[The Pale Lantern Inn\|The Pale Lantern Inn]]. Room 4, always the only room available, carried its own curse: a mirror with a delayed reflection. At midnight, their sleep shattered as the mirror birthed wightlings, shadow-doubles mimicking their every move. Kovinar realized the mirror was cursed, and smashing it banished the creatures. Room 4 became their grim waypoint.   
> Elsewhere, at Kelm’s Tinctures, potions were identified without Squeaks swallowing them blindly. At [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Chapel of Vex Ceniza\|Chapel of Vex Ceniza]], [[06_NPCs/Gravekeeper Oth\|Gravekeeper Oth]] begged for aid—scarlet ravens were stealing skulls from his graveyard. The party tracked them into the forest and found a timid young priest, a servant of “her,” gathering skulls to feed his mistress’s strength. When frightened off, Squeaks gathered the skulls herself.
> The sky blackened. Hundreds—then nearly a thousand—scarlet ravens descended. In their midst, a winged woman struck the earth with force enough to ripple the ground like water. She buckled the knee of Squeaks and whispered _“say goodbye,”_ before driving a scarlet dagger into her back, twice. Then she drew her bow, fired an arrow at Vespertina, but was blocked by Kovinar.
> The name burned above them in scarlet fire: **[[06_NPCs/Malis Fiani, The Scarlet Raven\|Malis Fiani, The Scarlet Raven]].** Then the letters twisted, rearranging into another name—**[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]].** She vanished into the sky, leaving Squeaks lifeless on the ground and the party reeling with the truth.
> That night, Kovinar and Squeaks drank the last of Oth’s potions, every drop spent to survive until morning.
