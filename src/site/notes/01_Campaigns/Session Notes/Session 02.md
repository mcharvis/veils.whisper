# From Ashes to Ashrend 

**Date:** 08/11/2025
**Location:** Christine's House  
**DM:** Mike
**Players Present:** Ryan, Tristan, Christine, Jesus, Mike Charvis, Mike Crump 

## Introduction
> **Prepare to die.**
> One of you already has.
> Vespertina fell yesterday—struck down by [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]]'s cursed gradebook. She faced the God of Death Himself…and returned unchanged. Was this luck? Or his plan to 
> That night, as your bodies rested in the halls of the Whispering Asylum, something stirred.
> While others dreamed, Vespertina dreamt _with purpose_.
> 
> The Veiled Necrovitalis whispered through the cracks in the Veil, curling its fingers into her mind. Not cruel. Not kind. Just... _curious_.
> 
> It showed Vespertina a truth. It showed her that death is not the end. It is _material_. A resource. A teacher. A warden. And in that dream—among ashes and echoes—she learned one can shape death...even manipulate it.
> 
> When she woke, the air around her _felt colder_.  Her fingers… a little lighter.  And something empowering followed her out of the dream.
> 
> Now morning creeps through the blackened windows. The Asylum is still...for the first time in ages. But the Veil is whispering and Miren calls from Ya'a Thalor.   
> 
> And Vespertina? She doesn’t fear death anymore. She _knows his name._

## Summary
> Vespertina, freshly returned from her brush with [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]], awoke from a dream in which the [[Items/Magical/Veiled Necrovitalis\|Veiled Necrovitalis]] revealed death not as an ending, but as a resource to be shaped. She emerged colder, unafraid, and carrying two new spells: _Spare the Dying_ and _Animate Dead_. A secret visit with [[06_NPCs/Talia\|The Oracle]] cautioned Vespertina to be strategic about when to be bold, to remember her strengths. The oracle added that the [[Items/Magical/Veiled Necrovitalis\|Veiled Necrovitalis]] is a powerful artifact and could sway the mind to focus on the dead...and undead, if careless. It could eventually be used to command armies of undead...if left to it's own destiny.
> The party encounters a stone church, crumbling but stubbornly intact. Carved above the threshold are words in an old, psychic tongue—twisting as you try to read them. Some minds understand them as: “*To empty the soul is to sanctify the mind.*” The front doors creak inward on warped hinges, spilling moonlight across shattered tile and dust-thick air. The interior of Ya’a Thalor is a wreck of collapsed rafters, torn banners, and splintered pews—all drowned in silence. Until it isn’t.
>  _“BACK! KEEP THEM BACK!”_ A shout—gravel-throated, panicked. Steel crashes. Wood breaks.
> The party entered the ruins of [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]]’s ground floor, stumbling into a desperate battle—eight zombies and an ogre zombie besieging two [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]] veterans (Jonah & Jeremy) and a knight from the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]] named [[Varian\|Varian]]. The veterans fell, but the party assisttace, saved Varian's life. The unexpected encounter with zombies caused Varian to express bitterness with Jade Stronghold for sending him to his “death.” Regardless, Varian agreed to continue the mission of finding "the girl." Squeaks ate some strange mushrooms and became intoxicated. Squeaks found two [[Items/Heartseed Husk\|Heartseed Husk]]s, keeping one and giving the other to Vespertina.
> Vespertina found the sanctuary's copy of _The Rites of Sequestration_. Heedlessly, Varian destroy it. Before descending to the second level, [[06_NPCs/Sir Lucian Caelmoor\|Sir Lucian Caelmoor]] recovered an aged [[Scout's Note\|Scout's Note]] indicating that a mounted party from [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Oasis\|Oasis]] was likely inbound. The note recommended that Sanctifiers activate Code SP, a suicide pact.
> In the crypts, the party encountered Sanctifiers in battle with a small band of zombies. It became immediately apparent that these weren't uncoordinated fighters; they were an elite unit that required a tailored strategy focusing on learning their unique traits. 
> Squeaks attempted to grapple [[Korin Draal\|Korin Draal]] (Bulwark)...unsuccessfully and discovered she was surrounded by Sanctifiers. Tharc Lorn (Hollowborn) was using a spell to hold back a small pack of zombies, assisted by Maelrik Torne (Dominator). However, he was forced to refocus on the party as they targeted Veyra Calth (Bladedancer). Veyra was hit hard by a spell from Vespertina but was immediately healed by Seroh Vann (Penitent) ...effectively putting a target on his back. [[Korin Draal\|Korin Draal]] was the first to fall but was resurrected by Vespertina to sandwich Tharc between him and the zombies, allowing the zombies to feast on him from behind.
> Seroh was the first to fall. After multiple failed attempts to grapple Squeaks, Maelrik was slain, followed by Veyra. The battle was long and arduous but it showed the party that as the battlefield changes, they would have to change too.
> In the northern room, Duven Malch (Veilshifter) was found dying. He gasped, “_[[Maelth\|Maelth]] was supposed to hold the gate... We believed it was Oasis that was finally coming for Halric. Find [[Maelth\|Maelth]]. He knows everyth…_” in his final breath. 
> Vespertina discovered [[Items/Ashrend\|Ashrend]] a wicked, forked longsword once used by [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Oasis\|Oasis]] to kill vampires. History of this weapon revealed that it was stolen ages ago. The reputation of this weapon has transcended ages and would certainly be recognizable to [[Varian\|Varian]]. Regardless, Vespertina gave the historic weapon to [[Varian\|Varian]] hoping to gain leverage in [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Oasis\|Oasis]]. In the western room, a foyer revealed a crypt copy of _The Rites of Sequestration_ . There was a page that was looser and newer than the others, as if added after the book was written. It was an excerpt from _The Rites of Sequestration_ entitled _Custody of the Sleepless_. The excerpt covertly revealed that [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Halric\|Sanctifier Halric]] was not looked on favorably by other Sanctifiers, stating that "no light shines favorably on him." Opening his crypt revealed a body with an ornate key laying on top.
> Kovinar opened Jornis' crypt and triggered a [[03_Lore/Psychic Vision of Miren’s First Night\|Psychic Vision of Miren’s First Night]]. Squeaks acquired Potion of Mind Reading was used  to secretly glimpse Kovinar’s vision. Varian found Maelth’s crypt was empty, its mirror showing him chained in a cell he recognizes to be at [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]]. Squeak ate the severed tongue in Yllin's crypt.
> On the third level, Miren was found older than expected but imprisoned in a makeshift cell locked by enchantment. Initially fearful, Miren was told that the party was there to rescue her...having found [[Items/Non-Magical/M’s note\|her note to her mother]] and [[Items/Non-Magical/Letter to M\|her mother's note]] given to [[06_NPCs/Farrún, The Wayfinder\|Farrún, The Wayfinder]] in the forest. Miren said that the only way to open the door was to acquire the key guarded by [[The Dreaming Mouth\|The Dreaming Mouth]]. She went on to describe that she has uncontrolled psychic power and, if attacked, enters her "dream state," a physical transformation that allows her to unleash tremendous power. Miren told the party that when she was a girl, her mother was taking her to [[02_World/Ahrown, The Kingdom of Elves/Talazan Academy\|Talazan Academy]] to learn to be a sorceress when her mother was captured by unknown soldiers. She said her mother, [[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|Velura Elaris]], was a kind sorceress bound to [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]]. She left to [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]] afterwards. As Vespertina was quietly recalling that Tisiphone is one of the three sisters charged with protecting a shard of the [[Items/Magical/Death-Wrought Mosaic\|Death-Wrought Mosaic]], Miren quietly told Vespertina that she knew her father was dead....and that "he's...here." 
> In mercy, Kovinar used the [[Items/Magical/Forgotten Memory Charm\|Forgotten Memory Charm]] to remove her memory of her first night in Ya'a Thalor and Vespertina gave Miren [[Items/Magical/Stuffed Bear of Forgotten Sorrows\|her stuffed teddy bear]], sparing the party from psychic wrath via her "dream state." She spoke of [[The Dreaming Mouth\|The Dreaming Mouth]], in a sanctuary of ten pillars, five on either side. She says the monster is slow but deadly but hiding can help reduce damage. She says there is another past the well...monster that “doesn’t look like one.” 
> Miren directed the party to a secret cache of strange potions, some of which were quite harmful. Squeaks tasted a strange grey potion and nearly lost her voice. 
> Vespertina harnessed the power in the [[Items/Magical/Veiled Necrovitalis\|Veiled Necrovitalis]] and slipped by a zombie infestation. She followed a trail of blood to the room where [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]] gave birth to [[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]] and found a [[Items/Non-Magical/journal letter from Miren\|journal letter from Miren]]. They began hearing screams down the hallway. One door at the end lead to the Inescapable Room, a room with mines embedded in the floor. There were 3 skeletons over blast marks, evidence that mines had killed some unknown visitors. [[Korin Draal\|Korin Draal]] was used to navigate the room to a doorway covered in stone with a stone amulet in the center. Removing it caused the stones to crumble and revealed the portal Miren had once used to traverse between the Asylum and Ya’a Thalor. The other door was opened to find a female sanctifier strapped to a rust-crusted table, her limbs trembling and blood-soaked. One leg was twisted unnaturally, her robes shredded and scorched. An ogre zombie loomed over her, its decaying fist clenched around a morningstar, crusted with bone and hair. The wrecked woman was choking on blood as the ogre zombie pummeled her body. Vespertina animated the three skeleton to assist her and squeaks in slaughtering the ogre. At the brink of death, the woman was given a Greater Potion of Healing before she revealed herself as [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]]. Virelle described the effects of the strange potions. Squeaks told Virelle that she killed her daughter (despite actually being killed by [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar Relkth\|Kovinar Relkth]]) and was left in the room. Vespertina used a used potion bottle to sample the purple liquid in the barrels protected by the zombies. Squeaks drank it...discovering a undisturbed cache of wine.
> In the northeastern hallways, the party found an alchemy table and a well. Inside the well, Vespertina found a Memory Pearl, a treasure granting one truthful answer from the Dreaming Mouth. Renzo’s familiar proceeded into the well and discovered a spider-patrolled canyon with gold a path leading to the basement level of Jade Stronghold.
> Lastly, a torn note in the Council Room confirmed [[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|Velura Elaris]]’s imprisonment in Jade Stronghold and that the Sanctifiers withheld this information from [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]] and intended to invade [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]] to capture Velura as leverage to reach Tisiphone.
