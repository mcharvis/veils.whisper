## üß≠ Summary
> In a clash with a white dragon, a demilich emerged from a charred portal and summoned Xaphan back to Necromanteion to answer for his defiance against the will of [[06_NPCs/Gods/Nerull\|Nerull]]. Afterwards, Squeaks, a rogue half-orc with a zombified rat ([[06_NPCs/Pets/Wilson\|Wilson]]), emerges from the trees. "They've taken him, haven't they?" The party discovers that Xaphan had been maintaining a secret friendship with Squeaks and using necromancy to keep her rat alive. Squeaks joined the party in pursuit of their mutual friend. 
> Before departing, Xaphan entrusted his belongings ([[Items/Magical/The Cursed Cross\|The Cursed Cross]], the [[Items/Magical/Veiled Necrovitalis\|Veiled Necrovitalis]], and a piece of the the [[Items/Magical/Death-Wrought Mosaic\|Death-Wrought Mosaic]]) to Kovinar, Vespertina, and Squeaks, respectively with vague instructions to save him from the grasp of Nerull. The trio pursued him through the portal to [[01_Campaigns/Encounters/Encounter 3 - The Forgotten Swamp\|The Forgotten Swamp]], where they met a woman claiming to be [[06_NPCs/Talia\|The Oracle]]. She revealed that Xaphan didn't just arrive moments before but had passed through the portal 1,600 years prior‚Äîconfirming that time flows differently in [[Elarith\|Elarith]]. She told them that the location of the other three pieces of the Death-Wrought Mosaic were in the charge of [[The Three Sisters\|The Three Sisters]] ([[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]], [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Hecate\|Hecate]], & [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Nyx\|Nyx]]). They also learned that the mosaic would provided passage *to* the Veil, but not *through* it.
> In the swamp, the group uncovered the [[Items/Magical/Cinderflare Wayfinder\|Cinderflare Wayfinder]] and a regional map. They exited the swamp and emerged through a broken wall in [[01_Campaigns/Encounters/Encounter 4 - Temple of the Forgotten Hero\|The Temple of the Forgotten Hero]]. Inside, four temple knights initiated battle. Three were slain, but Kovinar used Divine Salvation to spare [[06_NPCs/Sir Lucian Caelmoor\|Sir Lucian Caelmoor]], who then joined him in battle. A druid by the name of [[05_Player Characters/Renzo Morokami\|Renzo Morokami]] stumbled upon the party in the midst of combat and joined them, as well. 
> Upon leaving the temple, they arrived at a [[01_Campaigns/Encounters/Encounter 5 - Night Camp\|Night Camp]] and found the skeletal remains of [[06_NPCs/Farr√∫n, The Wayfinder\|Farr√∫n, The Wayfinder]], who had been carrying [[Items/Non-Magical/Letter to M\|a letter]] from [[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|a mysterious woman]] addressed to her [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|daughter]] (Firefly/Dreamberry) after being captured by an unknown party - possibly for "something she could do or who she was." The note was half-burned but the skeleton appeared to have been bewitched and spoke in a woman's voice to reveal the other half of the letter. The voice advised her daughter to avoid places "that promise asylum" or places "that promise to fix what they do not understand." In the campfire, they also found a [[Items/Non-Magical/M‚Äôs note\|note]], partially burned by Renzo's magic trick‚Äîwritten by ‚ÄúM.‚Äù‚Äîsaying she was heading to a nearby house where other children were and hoped she could sleep there...revealing that "M" likely never received her mother's letter of caution. Review of the regional map indicated that "M" likely went to [[01_Campaigns/Encounters/Encounter 6 - The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]].

## üîç Clues & Lore
- **[[Items/Magical/Cinderflare Wayfinder\|Cinderflare Wayfinder]]**: Legends of the Cinderflare Wayfinder have mostly been lost to time. A scorched page in a ruined chronicle claims fire artisans forged the ring using the final breath of a phoenix. Other texts suggest rebel mages used it to escape collapsing planar portals during the [[Siege of the Ember Gate\|Siege of the Ember Gate]]. By the time scholars recovered its name, its trail had already grown cold. The ring‚Äôs current whereabouts have been thought to be unknown.
- **[[The Three Sisters\|The Three Sisters]]**: Tisiphone, Hecate, Nyx. Unknown importance. 
- **[[06_NPCs/Sir Lucian Caelmoor\|Sir Lucian Caelmoor]]**: One of **four knights** who remain within the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Temple of the Forgotten Hero\|Temple of the Forgotten Hero]], stationed in deliberate formation sworn to protect a memory.  Lucian was once the most outspoken of the [[04_Organizations/Ebony Wake\|Ebony Wake]], a knightly order known for its fierce loyalty to ideals over kings. He followed the [[06_NPCs/Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame\|Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame]] into exile and stood by them during the final betrayal. When the Hero fell, Lucian did not seek vengeance. He and three others chose a different oath‚Äî**one of remembrance through service**, not bloodshed. He bound himself to the tomb willingly, not through necromancy or divine coercion, but through sheer conviction.
