The night air outside Jade Stronghold tastes of iron and stone dust. You slip into the portal with Velura, her breath shallow, her wrists raw from years of shackles.  

Then—  
A tremor runs through the ground outside the stronghold.

From the treeline, shapes emerge. Dozens. Dozens upon dozen. Dark robes, steel glinting under half-shrouded moons. Thirty… forty at least. Elite Sanctifiers. They march in silence, armor painted with ash and crimson, faces hidden behind masks carved in the likeness of hollow-eyed saints.

Their formation tightens around the stronghold, like carrion birds circling prey. At their head, a figure raises a staff carved from bone, its tip pulsing faintly with violet light. The command is not shouted, but carried on some psychic current—_they are here to extract Velura._

The Sanctifiers do not see you. The darkness surrounding Velura swallows you whole. 

- Ropes and grappling hooks begin to fly and attach to the 6th floor.
- Sanctifiers pour onto the walls like a flood of locusts.
- A horn inside the keep bellows in alarm. Guards shout, doors slam, boots hammer on stone.

Velura stiffens, clutching at your sleeve. Her eyes are wide—not in fear of escape, but in recognition. “They’ve come for me,” she whispers. “Let's go,” she says as the portal snaps shut.
