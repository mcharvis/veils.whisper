You conjure radiant chains of memory and anguish, binding a creature’s mind.

Choose one creature you can see within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become **chained** for the duration. While chained, the target takes **9 (2d8) radiant damage** at the start of each of its turns and has disadvantage on attack rolls and on ability checks using Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.

#### Emotion Siphon

When a creature fails its initial saving throw against this spell, you may choose to siphon one named emotion (such as fear, rage, joy, grief, or hope). The target suffers an additional penalty for **1 hour**:

- **Fear:** The creature’s **AC is reduced by 2** as hesitation leaves it exposed.
- **Rage:** The creature’s **melee weapon attacks deal half damage (rounded down)**.
- **Joy:** The creature’s **maximum hit points are reduced by 25%** (rounded down) for 1 hour as vitality drains away.
- **Love:** The creature cannot use **reactions** (including opportunity attacks).
- **Grief:** The creature has **disadvantage on all attack rolls** with ranged weapons and spells that target a creature.
- **Hope:** The creature takes a **–1 penalty to attack rolls and AC**.

When the spell ends, you conjure a faint crystalline vial that contains the stolen emotion. The vial is mundane in weight and size, but radiates faint magic. It remains stable for 24 hours, after which it evaporates harmlessly.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the radiant damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
