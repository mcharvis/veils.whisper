### Journal of R. Calvra

She has not stopped screaming.

She was found at our doorstep without warning, wrapped in a blood-drenched cloth. I recognized the sigils sewn into the hem—Sanctifier work, hastily ripped. I suspect the mother did not act with their blessing.

The girl is odd. This place is already on the edge. We are stretched thin with the forest children, the night terrors, the endless audits from [[06_NPCs/Councilor Varn Drest\|Councilor Drest]]. I cannot afford another scandal.

 I’ve cleared out the south storeroom. Cold, yes, but quiet. No windows. No mirrors.

I informed the staff and children that she was taken in by a remote chapter.

Let this be my mercy.
