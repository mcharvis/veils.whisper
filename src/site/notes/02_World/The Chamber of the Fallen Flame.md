The passage opens into a vast rectangular chamber, its ceiling lost in shadow. The air is still here—no drip of water, no echo of wind—just the heavy quiet of a place that was never meant to be disturbed.

At the center stands a **statue nearly twenty-five feet tall**.

It depicts a warrior in full armor, one boot planted on the severed head of a massive dragon. The dragon’s jaws are frozen mid-snarl, stone fangs bared, eyes carved with such precision that they almost seem wet. Coins and broken offerings litter the base, half-melted into the rock as if left by hands that did not expect to return.

The warrior’s posture is wrong in a subtle way.

He is not triumphant.  
He is not posing.

He stands the way a commander stands at the end of a battle—weapon raised, shield lowered slightly, attention fixed forward as if the fight might resume at any moment.

The craftsmanship is **unsettlingly realistic**.  
Every dent in the armor looks earned.  
Every crease in the cloak looks heavy.  
Even the veins in the warrior’s hands are carved with anatomical precision.

This is not idealized stone.

This is **a body remembered exactly as it was**.
