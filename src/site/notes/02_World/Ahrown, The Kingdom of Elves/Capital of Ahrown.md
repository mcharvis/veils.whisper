[[06_NPCs/King Aldenor\|King Aldenor]] - Mad King of Ahrown, Vespertina's dead father
#location

**The Approach**  
The land dies long before the walls rise into view. Fields of withered crops stand upright as if frozen in time, untouched by scavengers or rot. The silence is wrong: no birds, no insects, no wind. At night, the horizon burns faintly green, the glow of soulfire that fuels the city.

**The Walls and Gates**  
Ahrown is encircled by walls of fused bone and obsidian, carved with screaming faces that shift when stared at too long. The gates are black iron taller than any fortress, etched with chains and runes. Guards are not living beings—they are elf-shaped husks, their armor grafted to their flesh, eyes hollow caverns spilling green light. Their mouths move when they speak, but the words come from somewhere deeper, as though many voices speak through one body.

**Inside the Capital**  
The city is full, but not alive. Streets teem with the undead: desiccated elves, their flesh pulled tight, draped in rotting finery. They move with eerie grace, smiling too wide, performing the routines of daily life as if bound by invisible strings. A market sells wares no one eats. Taverns ring with laughter that never touches the eyes. Music drifts from every corner, brittle, sharp, as though performed by broken instruments. And woven through it all: the smell of embalming herbs, thick and cloying.

**The Mad King’s Court**  
At the heart of Ahrown towers the **[[Dark Palace\|Dark Palace]]**, a spire of charred bones mortared with blood. It gleams under false starlight, every surface polished, immaculate, sterile. Inside, the King presides upon a throne of vertebrae. He is both magnificent and ruined: a once-noble elven figure whose flesh never decayed properly. His crown has fused into his skull, his teeth chatter when he laughs. He is recognized as mad not because he rages, but because he whispers—to his daughter who is not there. And sometimes, those corpses whisper back.

Every citizen is a prisoner in a macabre theater. To falter is to be remade. To resist is to be harvested.

**The King’s Madness**  
The King’s obsession with his daughter permeates everything. Statues of her likeness stand in every square. His anthem, a lullaby, plays from organs crafted of ribcages. Entire streets have been renamed to echo her childhood nicknames. But no one dares speak of her. Those who do vanish into the dungeons beneath the [[Dark Palace\|Dark Palace]], returning only as hollow shells, their voices gone.

When your player discovers that this tyrant—the skeletal monarch who built a kingdom of death in her memory—is her father, it won’t just be a gut punch. It will be a revelation that she has been the invisible axis around which this nightmare city has turned for centuries.
