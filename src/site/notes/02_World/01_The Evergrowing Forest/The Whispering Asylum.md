## Summary

A one-story stone asylum/orphanage nestled deep in the [[Evergrowing Forest\|Evergrowing Forest]], long abandoned but eerily intact. It is a place where the walls still remember, and the halls still echo with voices that shouldn’t exist.


## Appearance

- Wide, low stone structure—stained with moss and rain rot
- Blackened windows that resemble hollow eyes
- Hand-painted sign still intact: “**Whispering Asylum**”
- The building is not ruined—but it _should_ be
- Interior architecture is wrong—too symmetrical, too quiet

## History

Originally founded by psychic monks from the [[Order of the Morrow Veil\|Order of the Morrow Veil]], the Asylum was meant to be a sanctuary for those “afflicted by unseen tongues”—children and adults haunted by visions, voices, or dreams that predicted things no one else should know.

Over time, care turned into containment. The more the Veil frayed, the more the patients began to “echo”—mimicking each other’s speech, screaming in unison, or drawing the same symbols in their blood.

The Order abandoned the building. But the Headmistress refused to leave, trying to hide her treatment of the past children.

## Known Features

### Foyer

- Three doors:
    - **Left**: Bug-infested room with a chest holding a Water Explorer’s Pack
    - **Right**: Playroom with children’s toys and a single ornate chair
    - **Center**: Leads into the chapel

### Chapel

- 3 of 4 pews shattered
- Broken stained glass depicting a mouth sewn shut
- Left Door: Library with a bookcase and a **spellbook containing _Disguise Self_**
- Right Door: Stairwell descending to the Crypt Level

### Sublevels

- **Crypt Level**: Goblins, vampire hunting tools, a cage trap, and embalming rooms
- **Third Level**: Strange sanctuary, mysterious well, and a locked **Inescapable Room** with a rune-sealed door leading to [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]]
