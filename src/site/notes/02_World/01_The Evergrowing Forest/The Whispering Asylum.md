Nestled deep in the heart of the [[Evergrowing Forest\|Evergrowing Forest]], the **Whispering Asylum** sits like a stone secret waiting to be unearthed. A wide, low orphanage built of moss-covered stone and rain-slick shingles, the building appears oddly intact despite its age. Its blackened windows resemble hollow eyes. A hand-painted sign still hangs above the front steps, flaking gold letters reading: **“Whispering Asylum.”** The place is not ruined—but it _should_ be.

Inside, the architecture is wrong. The halls are too symmetrical. The air is too still. Footsteps echo in unnatural patterns, like the walls are listening. The building feels preserved not by time, but by intention—**something doesn’t want it to decay.** Dust doesn’t settle. Doors close gently when no one’s watching.

Founded by psychic monks of the [[Order of the Morrow Veil\|Order of the Morrow Veil]], the Asylum was once a sanctuary for those plagued by "unseen tongues"—children and adults haunted by voices, dreams, or prophetic visions. But over time, care gave way to containment. The afflicted began to “echo”—screaming in unison, drawing identical symbols in blood, or mimicking each other’s hallucinations. As the fabric of the Veil thinned, the Asylum became less of a refuge and more of a cage.

Eventually, the monks fled. But **Headmistress [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]] refused to leave.** Obsessed with secrecy, she remained behind to hide what had been done to the children—and what she had become. Her presence still lingers. Some say she’s not truly alive. Others say she never was.

The halls are not empty. Ghosts roam quietly—some cruel, others simply lost. [[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]], the secret child of Sanctifiers Halric and Virelle, was never raised—**only hidden**. Her presence warped the Asylum long before it fell. The spirit of [[Magda Velt\|Magda Velt]], the Lunch Matron, still stirs in the kitchen. A rare benevolent figure, she sometimes offers food, protection, or riddles spoken through the clatter of spoons.

Some say the building hums with the same lullaby heard in the ruins of [[Ya’a Thalor\|Ya’a Thalor]]—the one [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]] used to sing before she escaped through a tunnel beneath the floorboards. That tunnel is still there, sealed behind cracked stone, waiting to be reopened.

The Asylum doesn’t want to be found.

But it **remembers**.
