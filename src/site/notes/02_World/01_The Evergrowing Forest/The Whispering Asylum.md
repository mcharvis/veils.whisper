## Summary

A one-story stone asylum/orphanage nestled deep in the [[Evergrowing Forest\|Evergrowing Forest]], long abandoned but eerily intact. 


## Appearance

- Wide, low stone structure—stained with moss and rain rot
- Blackened windows that resemble hollow eyes
- Hand-painted sign still intact: “**Whispering Asylum**”
- The building is not ruined—but it _should_ be
- Interior architecture is wrong—too symmetrical, too quiet

## History

Originally founded by psychic monks from the [[Order of the Morrow Veil\|Order of the Morrow Veil]], the Asylum was meant to be a sanctuary for those “afflicted by unseen tongues”—children and adults haunted by visions, voices, or dreams that predicted things no one else should know.

Over time, care turned into containment. The more the Veil frayed, the more the patients began to “echo”—mimicking each other’s speech, screaming in unison, or drawing the same symbols in their blood.

The Order abandoned the building. But the Headmistress refused to leave, trying to hide her treatment of the past children. 

## Hauntings

- _The Drowned Girl_: Found in the tub in the Headmistresses private bathroom.
- [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]]: Aberration posing as a woman, still enforces the rules of the old Order
- [[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]]: the child of a forbidden Sanctifier union—a secret pregnancy between [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Halric\|Sanctifier Halric]] and [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Virelle\|Sanctifier Virelle]] 
- [[06_NPCs/Magda Velt, The Lunch Matron\|Magda Velt, The Lunch Matron]]: A rare benevolent ghost—may offer clues, food, or protection

## Secrets

- [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]] escaped through a hidden tunnel beneath the Asylum
