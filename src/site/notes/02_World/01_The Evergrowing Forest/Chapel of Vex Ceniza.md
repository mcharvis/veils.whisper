### The Life of Malrik Ceniza

Once a warlord’s bastard son, Ceniza grew up in siege camps among starving soldiers and rotting corpses. He learned quickly that the dead outnumbered the living and that loyalty was a chain even easier to shatter in death than in life.

Taking the title **Vex** — the necromancer’s renunciation of family and honor — Ceniza forged his name in smoke and ash.  

Ceniza’s art was not subtle: he drove entire villages before him, raising their fallen in waves until his enemies drowned in a tide of gray-fleshed corpses. Where he passed, only soot and bone fields remained.

### His Notable Death

Ceniza’s end came at the **Siege of Black Hollow**, where he performed his final ritual: binding not an army, but a **city**. He exhumed every corpse buried within its walls and set them upon the defenders.

Cornered, he invoked one last spell to transform his own body into cinders that spread like a plague. Soldiers claimed his **burning silhouette walked for three days** after his body was destroyed, scattering ashes that whispered like voices.

When finally nothing remained but a mound of black dust, long before Oasis, priests gathered the ashes and sealed them under stone, building a chapel above as a monument. Later, the city of Oasis was built up around it.

### The Chapel Today

The **Chapel of Vex Ceniza** is tended by **Gravekeeper Oth**, who insists the relics within are sacred and sealed. Yet Oth refuses to sweep the altar clean of its gray dust, saying:

> “That’s not ash. That’s Ceniza’s shadow. Sweep it, and he follows you home.”


Inside the Chapel of Vex Ceniza, [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]] shed her name and her vestments, becoming [[06_NPCs/Malis Fiani, The Scarlet Raven\|Malis Fiani, The Scarlet Raven]]. How she came to wield such power is unclear — some whisper she bartered with one of Nerull's dukes.
