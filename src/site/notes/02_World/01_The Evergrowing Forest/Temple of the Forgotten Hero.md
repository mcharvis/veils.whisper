_Resting place of Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame_

The temple doesnâ€™t rise from the swampâ€”it **sinks** into it.  
Stone columns jut from the muck like the fingers of a buried titan. Moss drapes every surface. Ivy strangles the cracked reliefs of long-faded valor. This was once a shrine, a sanctuary, **a promise**â€”but time has reshaped it into something mournful.

This is the final resting place of [[06_NPCs/Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame\|Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame]] - A knight whose name once rang like a war cry, now reduced to a whisper etched in wet stone. He was entombed here by the knights of [[04_Organizations/Ebony Wake\|Ebony Wake]].

Caelenâ€™s **four spectral knights** used to linger hereâ€”shades of the past, armorless and silent, bound by oath not to protect the tomb from intruders, but to **weigh intentions**. Those aligned with the Flameâ€”whatever that may now meanâ€”are permitted to pass unchallenged. 

Three of the knights were killed by [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]], [[05_Player Characters/Vespertina\|Vespertina]], [[05_Player Characters/Squeaks\|Squeaks]], & [[05_Player Characters/Renzo\|Renzo]].

### ðŸ”¥ The Hole in the Wall â€“ A Scar, Not a Breach

One side of the tomb bears a jagged openingâ€”not fresh, not the work of cultists or weather. **A scar**, not a wound. Stone sloughed away like dead flesh. It leads out into [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Forgotten Swamp\|The Forgotten Swamp]], but its presence is **deliberate**. The wall was destroyed by raiders searching for [[Items/Magical/The Cursed Cross\|The Cursed Cross]] but they never found it. 

The hole in the wall is still used by someone.... a woman calling herself [[06_NPCs/Talia\|The Oracle]], claiming to guide adventurers toward **Xaphanâ€™s prophecy**. Her path is **self-serving**, paved with vague-truths and veiled motives. She doesnâ€™t want to destroy the Veilâ€”she just wants to find [[05_Player Characters/Inactive/Xaphan\|Xaphan]].
