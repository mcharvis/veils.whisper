**Ya’a Thalor** was once a proud forest church run by the **Sanctifiers**, a sect of **psychic priests** who believed that **emotion was a parasite** and **memory a wound**. To them, the mind was a battlefield littered with the corpses of yesterday—and healing meant erasure.

They developed something called **Mind-Chains**—ritual bindings of thought and flesh that allowed them to extract guilt, trauma, and **madness** from others. These mental afflictions, however, couldn’t simply vanish.

They discovered they could only be stored in **bodily fluids**—blood, saliva, tears, bile, sweat, urine. The Sanctifiers bottled the worst parts of human experience in **vats and vessels**, buried them in the depths, and whispered thanks for the silence.

But **the church was never meant to hide something dark**.

It **became** dark.

As more secrets, sorrows, and fractured psyches were sealed beneath the floorboards, something began to form—a **psychic organism**, an accidental monster:

> [[06_NPCs/The Dreaming Mouth\|The Dreaming Mouth]].

A seething, formless presence born of **condensed emotion and fragmented identity**, it stirred in the **deep root-level** of Ya’a Thalor, feeding on the emotions of the forgotten.

The Sanctifiers managed to **contain it**, but the cost was staggering. To calm it, they turned to the only being who ever seemed to make it sleep.

### **Miren Elaris**

They found Miren in the lower level of Ya'a Thalor after escaping from [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]], a child with unpolished psychic magic.  

So they **caged her** deep beneath Ya’a Thalor so that [[06_NPCs/The Dreaming Mouth\|The Dreaming Mouth]] lay dormant.

### **The Elven Dead Arrive**

**Halric’s junior Sanctifiers** were carrying out the [[Battles/The Breach During Virelle’s Punishment\|scheduled punishment]] of [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]]—discipline for her forbidden birth of Nasha—when the dead breached the outer walls of Ya’a Thalor. The juniors abandoned the chamber to confront the threat, regrouping on the ground floor in formation.

They never returned.

The assault began in **Arhown**, the fractured elven province ruled by the mad [[06_NPCs/King Aldenor\|King Aldenor]]. In a calculated strike, elven necromancers turned their efforts toward crippling [[04_Organizations/The Sanctifiers\|The Sanctifiers]] by targeting **Ya’a Thalor**, hoping to thin their numbers and reclaim control over [[The Evergrowing Forest\|The Evergrowing Forest]].

Their forces—twisted elven dead—entered the forest without resistance.

Within days, **Ya’a Thalor was under siege**.

The Sanctifiers fought to hold it, but the invaders weren’t mindless.  
They moved with purpose.  
They **knew the layout**.  
They **ignored fear**.

And they didn’t stop.

### **The Abandonment and the Forgotten**

The Sanctifiers fled.

They left behind relics, corpses, broken Mind-Chains still wet with tears. In the comotion, they forgot **Nemor Thass**—a timid Hollowborn, a memory-keeper, now trapped and whispering backwards verses in a locked chamber on the second floor.

The church fell silent again, but not empty. **Miren’s is still imprisoned in the lowest level** but only a few know thatp...

### **Jade Stronghold’s Recon**

Weeks later Jade Stronghold ordered a **reconnaissance team** to enter the ruin and assess the threat. Three soldiers breached the entrance but were ambushed by some remaining zombies.
