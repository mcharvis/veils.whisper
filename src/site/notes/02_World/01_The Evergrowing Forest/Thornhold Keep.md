- A once-glorious noble family whose sigil is a dying tree beneath a black sun.
    
- House **Vaer-Lorne** has ruled Oasis for generations. They keep the peace, fund defenses, and uphold tradition—but their leadership has grown hollow, rigid, and fearful of change.
    
- They are not cruel, but their arrogance and detachment make them blind to the town’s slow unraveling.

**Thornhold Keep** rises like a scar above Oasis, its jagged battlements giving the impression of thorns tearing at the sky. Once, it was the shining emblem of House **Vaer-Lorne**, whose rule stretched unbroken across generations.  

In its prime, Thornhold was a beacon. The Vaer-Lorne lords funded the walls of Oasis, commanded its defenses, and poured coin into the rituals and feasts that bound the town together. They were seen as guardians of both order and heritage, a dynasty that endured by standing firm against the shifting chaos of the Evergrowing Forest.

But centuries of unchallenged rule calcified into something brittle. The Vaer-Lornes are not tyrants—they do not lash their people with cruelty, nor starve them with greed. Instead, they wound with negligence. Their nobles live insulated within Thornhold’s stone belly, staring at relics of the past while Oasis slowly unravels outside their gates. The people whisper that their lords govern by memory, clinging to traditions that no longer protect the present.

Inside Thornhold’s halls, grandeur lingers but is fraying. Tapestries rot in shadowed corners, feasts are served to dwindling courts, and decisions are made by weary men and women whose arrogance blinds them to how thin their rule has become. Fear of change—fear of losing control—guides their every policy. They fund defenses not to strengthen Oasis, but to preserve their seat; they dismiss unrest as the folly of commoners rather than a symptom of decay.…

For all their faults, the Vaer-Lornes are not evil. They are simply blind. They mistake their detachment for wisdom, their rigidity for stability. And that blindness may prove more dangerous than malice, for it leaves Oasis vulnerable to those who thrive in the cracks between power and neglect.
