Jade Stronghold is a fortress in the [[Evergrowing Forest\|Evergrowing Forest]], built from black stone veined with green jade. From a distance it looks harsh and unwelcoming, almost like the land itself doesn’t want it there. The forest stops short of its walls, and even the ground leading to the gate feels unnatural—swept clean without wind or hands.

The stronghold was built long ago by the rulers of Oasis to control the forest and anyone who lived near it. Over time it became more than a fort—it’s a prison, a barracks, and a political chessboard. Important prisoners are kept here, soldiers are stationed here, and backroom deals are struck in its council chambers.

When you arrive, the first impression is always the same: silence. Three guards wait at the entrance, motionless and watchful, while heavy dogs roam the courtyard without chains. 

The fortress was commanded by two figures: **[[06_NPCs/Councilor Varn Drest\|Councilor Varn Drest]]**, a political schemer from Oasis who uses the stronghold for his own advantage, and **[[06_NPCs/Commander Velexia\|Commander Velexia]]**, a strict but respected soldier who personally oversees the higher levels. The sorceress **[[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|Velura Elaris]]** was imprisoned in the central cell while Drest and Velexia pondered how to use her powers as a weapon for Oasis to target Sactifiers.

For the people of Oasis, Jade Stronghold has a mixed reputation. Some see it as protection against the dangers of the forest. Others see it as a place where people disappear and secrets pile up. Either way, anyone who enters quickly learns that survival here depends as much on politics and trust as it does on strength of arms.

### The Battle at Jade Stronghold

Recently, the stronghold became the site of a bloody clash. Armies gathered at its walls, and the fighting tore through its courtyards and halls. Many knights and soldiers gave their lives to hold the fortress, and the dead still weigh heavily on those who survived. The battle left scars—burned stone, shattered gates, and rooms filled with silence where once men and women stood. [[06_NPCs/Commander Velexia\|Commander Velexia]] barely survived the fighting, while [[06_NPCs/Councilor Varn Drest\|Councilor Varn Drest]] managed to slip away before the worst of it. Since then, Jade Stronghold has become more than just a fortress—it is now a graveyard and a symbol of how fragile Oasis’s hold on the forest truly is.
