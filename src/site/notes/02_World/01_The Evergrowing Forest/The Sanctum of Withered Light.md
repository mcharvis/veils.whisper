The **Sanctum of Withered Light** was born in the twilight years of Oasis’s fractured nobility. Outwardly, it positioned itself as a secretive yet benevolent order: a order of scholars who whispered counsel into the ears of dukes and councilors, guiding them toward piety and measured rule. Their name carried a paradoxical poetry—_withered light_ suggested humility, the dim glow of wisdom left behind after brighter fires had burned away. For centuries, the Sanctum cultivated this aura of mystery and quiet sanctity, advising kings, blessing heirs, and serving as moral anchors within [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Thornhold Keep\|Thornhold Keep]].

But behind cloistered doors, their light was anything but pure. The Sanctum had long been entangled with the **Sanctifiers**, that heretical order of zealots whose “faith” was twisted into experiments with blood, soul, and flesh. The nobles of Oasis, fearful of the growing chaos in the Evergrowing Forest and seduced by promises of new weapons, sanctioned projects that blurred the line between divine blessing and monstrous invention. And the Sanctum, desperate to maintain its influence at court, did not merely advise—they _enabled_.

In Ya’a Thalor’s early days of horror, the Sanctum’s brightest scholars helped design the prototype known as **[[Velvak’s Iron\|Velvak’s Iron]]**— a weapon not for war—but to deliver judgment through **purified pain**. It was used in **ritualized punishment**, **martyrdom rites**, and **anointments by fire**. Eventually, it was **sealed beneath [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Thornhold Keep\|Thornhold Keep]]** after [[06_NPCs/Velvak\|Velvak]] disappeared—whether consumed by the Flame or killed for going too far, no one knows.
