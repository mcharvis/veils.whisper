Outside the crumbling walls of the **Temple of the Forgotten Hero**, a fetid stretch of murky water and blackened roots chokes the forest.  

Long ago, whispers spread that [[Items/Magical/The Cursed Cross\|The Cursed Cross]] —a relic of dark origin and divine potential—had been hidden in the swamp bordering the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Temple of the Forgotten Hero\|Temple of the Forgotten Hero]]. Xaphan’s enemies believed he buried it here to hide its power from both Nerull and the living. The tale grew legs, twisted by cultists and relic hunters alike.

Raiders came—some in devotion, others in desperation. They broke through the tomb wall, defiling the resting place of an ancient hero. But they found nothing in the mire but silence, rot, and death. The Cross had never been here. **Xaphan carried the Cross with him**, unseen.

What the swamp did hide, though, was real.

Beneath its green film and reeking silt, hidden between a tangle of pale, underwater roots, lay the [[Items/Magical/Cinderflare Wayfinder\|Cinderflare Wayfinder]] —a relic that doesn’t just point the way, but _reveals_ it, glowing like an ember when pulled from the water.
