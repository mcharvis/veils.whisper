**Quest Giver:** Commander Velexia  
**Location:** Jade Stronghold, her command chamber (maps, documents, food on the table, soldiers nearby)  
**Hook:** Velexia sees Vespertina as a hardened survivor who “carry herself as though they’ve been closest to death.” She trusts them with something delicate no common courier or soldier could manage.

### The Ask

Velexia leans forward, her armor creaking softly, voice even but edged:

**Velexia:**  
“If we employed you and sent you north into Arhown, would you return with report on the Mad King’s condition for me? I must know if he is a threat, if he can be cured… or if he should be replaced.”

She wants the party to:

1. **Enter Arhown discreetly.** The city is hostile, ruled by an undead, paranoid king.
2. **Evaluate the king’s mental state.** Is he salvageable, dangerous, or already beyond help?
3. **Report back.** Not to the Assembly, not to Drest — _to her alone._
