#organization 

The **Sanctifiers** present themselves as holy wardens, protectors sworn to hold back corruption in the Evergrowing Forest. Their sermons ring with conviction, their banners still bear the sunlit sigils of faith, and they cloak themselves in the language of sacrifice and duty. To many in Oasis, they are heroes who dare to step into shadows where no sane soul would tread.

But the truth runs black beneath the whitewash. The Sanctifiers are not suppressing corruption—they are its architects. In the name of purification, they devised experiments that bind souls into relics, drain life through psychic torture, and lock the broken into prisons of unending ritual. What began as attempts to “fortify” mortals against the forest’s horrors twisted into something else entirely: a machine of suffering that feeds on its own victims.

And yet, they believe. That is their most dangerous quality. The Sanctifiers do not see themselves as villains. Each act of cruelty, each body shackled to an experiment, is a necessary cost to “save the greater whole.” They whisper that mortals are too weak to endure the world as it is—that only through fire, iron, and discipline can the soul be made incorruptible. To dissenters, they say: _You would prefer surrender? You would prefer rot to salvation?_

Despite their atrocities, the Sanctifiers maintain deep roots in Oasis. Nobles invite them to court. Priests debate theology with them. Some councilors secretly rely on their “protection,” accepting gifts of relics or blessings in exchange for influence. In this way, their presence is tolerated, even legitimized. The noble House Vaer-Lorne may not fully trust them, but neither do they dare uproot them—better to have the fanatics close, where their zeal can be directed, than risk open conflict.

To those who see clearly, the Sanctifiers are fanatics masquerading as guardians, poison in a chalice of holy water. They believe the world must be broken to be remade, and they are eager to be the hammer. The tragedy is not that they deceive others, but that they themselves are deceived. In their eyes, every atrocity is not corruption—it is salvation, writ in blood and fire.
