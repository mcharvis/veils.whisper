_Archdevil of Citadels and Secrets_

### Lore

Malphas is a Duke of Hell, once a favored general of Tiamat when she still ruled Avernus. He embodies duality: the master builder who can raise fortresses overnight, and the crow-trickster who lures mortals with promises of protection before betraying them.

When he manifests, he takes one of two forms:

- A dark-complexioned noble clad in black velvet studded with jewels, his eyes burning like coals, his voice smooth but cruel.
    
- A towering black crow with wings like charred banners, beak dripping sparks of fire.
    

Legends say Malphas can conjure citadels from ash and bone, only to topple them in betrayal when their builders trust him most. Cultists often call him **The Crow of the Velvet Court**, honoring both his gem-studded finery and his murder-bird form.

### Place in the Nine Hells

- **Title:** Duke of Hell, Master of the False Fortress
- **Domain:** Malphas serves in Avernus, but his citadels dot every layer of the Hells. He is often summoned by generals who seek temporary bastions during infernal wars.
- **Followers:** Warlocks and architects who crave power over fortifications, paranoid nobles who fear betrayal, and assassins who whisper prayers for his trickster’s insight.
- **Enemies:** Dispater loathes Malphas, seeing him as an upstart who meddles in the craft of iron towers. Zariel despises his duplicity but cannot deny his tactical brilliance.

### Goals

Malphas seeks to undermine the trust mortals place in stone, walls, and sanctuary. He delights in corrupting the idea of “safety.” His fortresses may protect his followers for a time, but when it matters most, he sells them out to Hell’s wars or to the highest bidder.

### Worship & Cults

Cults of Malphas are rare but insidious. They often appear in cities under siege or among mercenary bands, where he whispers promises of strongholds, enchanted weapons, and insight into enemies’ plans. His symbol is a **black crow clutching a ruby**.

Rituals often involve constructing miniature fortresses of bone, wood, or stone, only to destroy them in fire at the ritual’s end.

### The Scarlet Raven’s Place in His Story

Malphas reached into Elarith through the **Chapel of Vex Ceniza**, to claim a servant. The chapel, once steeped in the necromantic legacy of Vex Ceniza, became a crucible of betrayal. There, he whispered to **[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]]**, a former Sanctifier who lost everything. Vex Ceniza’s lingering death-echo opened the door, but it was Malphas who allowed Virelle to step through.

From that moment, Virelle ceased to be. She was remade into **[[06_NPCs/Malis Fiani, The Scarlet Raven\|Malis Fiani, The Scarlet Raven]]**, Malphas’ herald and knife. Where he builds false fortresses, she ensures the betrayal cuts deepest. She assassinates leaders, rends alliances, and leaves a trail of scarlet feathers as omens. Her brutality proves Malphas’ philosophy: no wall, oath, or faith can protect you.

In infernal lore, she is called his **“Living Flaw.”** Every citadel Malphas gifts carries her shadow already in its heart. When those walls crumble, she is the hand pulling the stone free. Where mortals pray to him for safety, she arrives to take their blood instead.

For Malphas, The Scarlet Raven is not just an agent — she is his _most convincing argument_. He does not need to promise betrayal; she has already delivered it.
