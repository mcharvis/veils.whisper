**Miren**, traumatized and unknowingly dangerous, escaped the **[[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]]** after her psychic powers disturbed the other children. Her escape is what brings the party into contact with this network of injustice.

Miren was a child patient at the Whispering Asylum, admitted after she was found in the woods. A trauma that caused her to stop speaking but start dreamingâ€”lucid, predictive, terrifying dreams. The asylum labeled her a "sleeper-seer," a rare phenomenon tied to intense psychic bleed. She spoke in riddles when asleep, wept memories that werenâ€™t hers, and once drew a picture of Yaâ€™a Thalorâ€™s altar years before anyone rediscovered it. While at the asylum, the children around her beganâ€¦declining. She escaped somehow.

The Sanctifiers found her in their lower levels. They saw her not as a victim, but as a keyâ€”a living conduit between their Mind-Chains and the deep subconscious field they worshipped. They abducted her under the guise of a transfer or death. The asylum listed her as "untraceable."

Now, sheâ€™s grown, physicallyâ€”but her mind is fractured across years of dreaming for others.

## Status

ðŸ§¬ **Found imprisoned in the lowest level of Ya'a Thalor** 
Fleed the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]] through a hidden tunnel. Currently in the dungeon of [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]].


## Background
Miren was born the daughter of a reclusive sorceress, [[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|Velura Elaris]] living at the edge of the [[Evergrowing Forest\|Evergrowing Forest]]. When Miren was 10, Velura was taking her to [[02_World/Ahrown, The Kingdom of Elves/Talazan Academy\|Talazan Academy]] to be evaluated for education as a sorceress when her mother was abruptly taken by agents from the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]]. Miren fled into the woods, but eventually travelled to the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]] in search of shelter.

The [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]], under the cruelty of its headmistress, became a prison instead. Her natural psychic abilitiesâ€”amplified by trauma and griefâ€”began to warp the emotions of others around her. The staff labeled her unstable. The children grew fearful.

But she found the hidden tunnel that lead to the lower levels of [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]].

## Known History

- Taken in by the Asylum around age 10
- Demonstrated dangerous psychic resonance during sleep
- Was isolated after causing multiple emotional breakdowns among other children
- Escaped through a tunnel beneath the Asylum, which she found after recurring dreams of a circular stone room
- Recaptured by the [[04_Organizations/The Sanctifiers\|The Sanctifiers]], who confined her to [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]] to pacify  a monster previously called "The Mouth."

## Personality
Quiet, observant, unnervingly empathetic. Miren often says little, but when she speaks, her words have weight. She's known to echo things others are about to sayâ€”sometimes days before they say them.

She doesnâ€™t trust institutions, but she still seeks connection.
