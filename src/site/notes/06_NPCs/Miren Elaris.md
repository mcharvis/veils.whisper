| ![[Miren - Portrait - Young.png\|Miren Elaris]] | **Miren**, traumatized and unknowingly dangerous, escaped the **[[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]]** after her psychic powers disturbed the other children. Her escape is what brings the party into contact with this network of injustice.<br><br>Miren was a child patient at the Whispering Asylum, admitted after she was found in the woods. A trauma that caused her to stop speaking but start dreamingâ€”lucid, predictive, terrifying dreams. The asylum labeled her a "sleeper-seer," a rare phenomenon tied to intense psychic bleed. She spoke in riddles when asleep, wept memories that werenâ€™t hers, and once drew a picture of Yaâ€™a Thalorâ€™s altar years before anyone rediscovered it. While at the asylum, the children around her beganâ€¦declining. She escaped somehow.<br> |
The Sanctifiers found her in their lower levels. They saw her not as a victim, but as a keyâ€”a living conduit between their Mind-Chains and the deep subconscious field they worshipped. They abducted her under the guise of a transfer or death. The asylum listed her as "untraceable."
