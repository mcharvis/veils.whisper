Rhoswyn Calvra was born in **[[Basville\|Basville]]**, a city known for its libraries, lanternlight lectures, and rigid social order. A prodigy in child development and behavioral correction, she graduated with honors from the [[02_World/Ahrown, The Kingdom of Elves/Talazan Academy\|Talazan Academy]], where she specialized in abnormal learning patterns and emotional calibration—a field that aimed to teach even the “unreachable” child.

She was bright, composed, and determined to fix what others gave up on.

Originally founded by psychic monks from the [[Order of the Morrow Veil\|Order of the Morrow Veil]] in [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Oasis\|Oasis]], the Asylum was meant to be a sanctuary for those “afflicted by unseen tongues”—children and adults haunted by visions, voices, or dreams that predicted things no one else should know. Calvra volunteered to lead it. She called it her “*final thesis made flesh.*”

She arrived with a curriculum. With order. With hope.

At first, **Rhoswyn Calvra** ran the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]] like a gifted boarding school. The children were disturbed, yes—but she saw them as misunderstood. She held lessons under lanternlight, taught breathing exercises, even established a “merit badge” system for emotional control. Her educational theories, once groundbreaking at [[02_World/Ahrown, The Kingdom of Elves/Talazan Academy\|Talazan Academy]], were tested daily in the shadowed, shifting halls of [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]].

But [[The Evergrowing Forest\|The Evergrowing Forest]] doesn’t care for pedagogy.

When **[[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]]** arrrived to the Whispering Asylum—barefoot, silent, and veiled in sorrow— Calvra saw not a child, but a _puzzle_. A rare “Type 0” anomaly, devoid of measurable fear responses and immune to her disciplinary models.

From the moment Miren arrived, things began to unravel.

- Children started **screaming in unison**, despite being in separate rooms.
- Staff members forgot where they were, who they were, even how long they had been working there.

The children began drawing **the same symbols**, whispering **the same names**, and waking in perfect synchrony from identical nightmares. Some claimed to see Rhoswyn _in their dreams,_ guiding them through endless classrooms of bleeding desks.

She blamed environmental stress. Then diet. Then each other.

But deep down, she felt it too: **the pressure behind the eyes**, the feeling of being observed by something _within_ the walls. The more she tried to control it, the more chaotic it became.

She stopped sleeping. Her lessons turned to chants. Discipline became ritual.

She replaced textbooks with journals of the children’s hallucinations. She burned her old syllabi and began writing new ones—etched in chalk onto the bones of deer and tied together in string-bound “lesson books.”

Eventually, she stopped referring to herself as a teacher.

She called herself **“The Architect of Composure.”**

Over time, care turned into containment. The more the Veil frayed, the more the patients began to “echo”—mimicking each other’s speech, screaming in unison, or drawing the same symbols in their blood.

The Order abandoned the building. But the Headmistress refused to leave, trying to hide her treatment of the past children.

Rhoswyn **tried everything** to contain it. Quiet time protocols. Isolation. Memory rewriting. Even kindness.

But no method worked. And Miren—terrified—eventually escaped. This was followed by a chorus of whispers echoed through the halls at night, all repeating the same question:
> “_Why did Miren leave us?_”

Children turned feral in their sleep. Staff screamed when left alone. The walls themselves began to “breathe” under the strain of madness. She documented it all, obsessively—still believing there must be a root cause, a method of control.  

She **didn’t know** it was [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]]. Even Miren didn't know.

And when she couldn’t fix them…She decided they were already _lost_. One by one, she began to “remove the chaos.”

She called it “**reformatting the curriculum.**” But it was murder. Cold, quiet murder, carried out beneath the sound of lullabies and the scratching of lesson plans.

One by one, the faculty abandoned the Whispering Asylum, but Rhoswyn never left. Because someone must protect the secret of what _she_ did...And what Miren unknowingly **caused.**
