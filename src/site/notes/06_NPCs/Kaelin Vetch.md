**Role:** Spy and informant for Liora  
**Origin:** Oasis  
**Allegiance:** Loyal first to [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]], second to Oasis and Liora 

### Background

Kaelin Vetch was born in [[The Evergrowing Forest\|The Evergrowing Forest]], the son of a failed merchant who drank himself into debt and an overworked mother who sold herbs in the street markets. From a young age, Kaelin started as a street rat who made coin by running errands, then by listening at windows, and eventually by selling secrets to whoever would pay.

By the time he was grown, Kaelin had made a reputation as someone who could be trusted to get information quietly. He didn’t fight, didn’t swagger, didn’t play at being a noble — he watched, remembered, and whispered. He had already worked for guilds and lesser Assembly members when **[[06_NPCs/Liora\|Liora]]** took notice. Unlike most who hired him, she treated him as more than a disposable tool. She offered him something rare: trust and steady work. Since then, Kaelin has been her ears in Oasis’s taverns, alleys, and back rooms.

### Personality

- **Cautious:** Avoids attention, blends into crowds.
- **Pragmatic:** Knows everyone is corrupt at some level, but still believes Liora is less so than the rest.
- **Twitchy:** Always seems half-ready to bolt, a habit from years on the street.
- **Sharp:** Speaks little, but when he does, it’s usually important.

### Role in the Story

Kaelin is Liora’s **link to the inner workings of Jade Stronghold**. He keeps her informed on Drest’s schemes. He isn’t a soldier or adventurer — if cornered, he’ll run before he fights. But his network of contacts and his ability to hear what others miss makes him valuable.

For the party:

- He is aligned with [[06_NPCs/Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] through [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]].
- He can act as a messenger between them and Liora.
- If caught, his knowledge could endanger both himself and Liora, making him a potential liability as well as an asset. He will attempt to kill himself if caught.
