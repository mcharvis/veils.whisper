**Status:** Echo (Residual Spirit)  
**Location:** Whispering Asylum Cafeteria  
**Former Role:** Cook, Caretaker, “Mother Magda”

Magda Velt wasn’t hired for her skill with knives—though she had that too—but for her warmth. In a place built to break children, she was a strange anomaly: a soft soul in an iron world. She hummed lullabies while she stirred broth and slipped second helpings to the skinny ones when no one was looking. Most called her “Mother Magda,” and she didn’t correct them. She never had children of her own.

But she _did_ have rules.

“Eat all your food.”  
“No talking while chewing.”  
“Never, ever let the broth go cold.”

The last rule was more than superstition. Magda believed the soup carried warmth that kept _something_ at bay—something that had started to creep into the Asylum’s walls. She never explained what she meant, only that hot soup helped them sleep. She would wake at midnight to reheat pots if she had to. If she didn’t, the children would scream in their sleep. Some would wake up wrong.

One night, she didn’t make the rounds.

She had slipped on a bit of spilled oil near the oven—cracked her head on the stone floor. Bled out among her bubbling pots and clattering pans. No one found her for hours. By then, the soup had gone cold.

That night, seven children died in their sleep. The others say the soup turned black.

Now, her **echo** lingers—half memory, half compulsion. She moves through the kitchen as if nothing has changed. Still ladling out food that no one eats. Still humming lullabies. Still warming soup that has long since gone bad. She doesn’t know she’s dead.

Sometimes she weeps, spoon in hand. Other times, she tilts her head at the players and says:

> “You _are_ eating, aren’t you? The broth is still warm… still warm…”

If anyone tries to avoid finishing what’s on their tray, she follows. Not in anger. In _concern_.

> “You need to eat. Eat, eat, eat!”
