An amalgamation of flesh made from the children the [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]] discarded. 

It wanders a room of corpses. It pulses like a heart too large for any creature, veined with tough fibrous tissue and stitched with remnants of children: small hands, tiny ribs, a skull half-embedded in its side, its jaw frozen mid-scream. The thing slithers rather than walks, dragging itself across the blood-slick floor with twitching limbs that look borrowed, mismatched, or stolen.

Dozens of eyes blink open upon it's skin blink and fixate on the intruders with a sick, childlike curiosity. From its torn mouth, stitched into a permanent grin, a lullaby bubbles up—wet, gurgling, and sung in the voices of children who no longer live.

It is not just a monster. It is what was made when innocence died, and something else crawled into its place.

### Lore

Rhoswyn Calvra’s bathroom was more than a place of ritual cleansing—it became a vault of atrocity. Each child she drowned or strangled was lowered into the bathtub, its porcelain bottom concealing a hollow deep enough to swallow their small frames. She believed the water would carry them away, that submersion would smother not only their lives but their memory. In the cesspool in the basement, their bodies softened and melded, hair tangling into ropes, skin peeling into veils, bones slipping loose until they no longer belonged to any one child. What she thought was a grave became a womb. The dead drew to one another, knitting into a single mass that shuddered with unspent breath. In time, the basement no longer hid them—the hollow birthed them. From the porcelain depths rose the Cradle of Flesh, a grotesque monument to every secret Calvra tried to drown.
