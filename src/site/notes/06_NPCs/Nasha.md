### 🕯️ Birth: “The Delivery”

Nasha is the child of a **forbidden Sanctifier union**—a secret pregnancy between **Sanctifiers Halric** and **Virelle**, a low-ranking psychic acolyte known for her devotion to Mind-Chain experimentation. Nasha was born in secret, alone, in a storage room beneath [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]]. Her mother, [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Virelle\|Sanctifier Virelle]], had defied The Order to terminate the pregnancy, fearing shame or reprisal if discovered. In silence and fear, Virelle wrapped the newborn in a tattered red blanket and left her newborn daughter on the cold stone threshold of the Whispering Asylum, still damp with afterbirth and secrecy. No note.  

It was Headmistress [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]] who found her first—woken by a silent scream in her sleep. She followed the sound not with her ears but with her mind, and when she opened the Asylum’s front door, she did not flinch at the infant left to the frost. She simply bent down, examined the girl’s eyes—silver-gray and wide—and whispered, “You do not belong here.”

### **Childhood in the Whispering Asylum**

Nasha wasn’t raised. She was hidden.

When Rhoswyn Calvra first saw the child—barely old enough to speak, wrapped in bloodied linens and left on the Asylum’s steps—she knew exactly who she was. The scandal could’ve unraveled everything. So Calvra did what she always did with problems: she buried it.  
Literally.

Nasha was locked in an unused storage room deep beneath the old chapel. A place with no bed, no toys, and no light. Just broken furniture, old linens, rusted tools—and rats. So many rats. She survived on them. At first out of desperation. Later, with eerie calm.

No one spoke to her. No one taught her. Yet Nasha learned. She listened through the walls. She mimicked the whispers. She began speaking words she had no way of knowing—old, forgotten tongues that tangled together like smoke in her mouth. She etched symbols into the wood with her fingernails. They pulsed when no one was looking.

By the time she was five, strange things had begun to happen. Lights dimmed when she opened her eyes. Doors refused to open when she was near. On the night the west wing caught fire, Nasha had calmly whispered, _“Three... two... one...”_ and the thunder cracked right on cue. Flames devoured half the dorms. Nasha just sat, cross-legged in the hall, soot on her cheeks, watching.

Eventually, Rhoswyn couldn’t keep her hidden. But by then it was too late. The other children avoided her—not out of cruelty, but instinct. Even the worst of them, the biters and screamers, gave her a wide berth. Rooms fell quiet when she passed. Some swore she could make you forget your own name just by staring.

Calvra kept her close after that—not out of guilt, not even out of strategy, but because she was afraid. Everyone was. Nasha didn’t cry. Didn’t laugh.  
She just watched.  
And listened.  
And remembered _everything_.
