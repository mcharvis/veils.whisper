### 🕯️ Birth: “The Delivery”

Nasha is the child of a **forbidden Sanctifier union**—a secret pregnancy between **Sanctifiers Halric** and **Virelle**, a low-ranking psychic acolyte known for her devotion to Mind-Chain experimentation. Nasha was born in secret, alone, in a storage room beneath the Whispering Asylum. Her mother, [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Virelle\|Sanctifier Virelle]], had defied The Order to terminate the pregnancy, fearing shame or reprisal if discovered. In silence and fear, Virelle wrapped the newborn in a tattered red blanket and left her newborn daughter on the cold stone threshold of the Whispering Asylum, still damp with afterbirth and secrecy. No note.  

It was Headmistress [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]] who found her first—woken by a silent scream in her sleep. She followed the sound not with her ears but with her mind, and when she opened the Asylum’s front door, she did not flinch at the infant left to the frost. She simply bent down, examined the girl’s eyes—silver-gray and wide—and whispered, “You do not belong here.”

### **Childhood in the Whispering Asylum**

Nasha grew up in a world that refused to grow with her. The Asylum was no place for healing—by the time she was five, she’d already seen drownings, disappearances, and “playtime” that ended in blood. The other children were unpredictable—violent, wild, or eerily calm. Nasha, in contrast, was quiet. Too quiet.

She rarely cried, rarely laughed. She simply watched. Listened.

Rhoswyn kept her close, not out of affection but suspicion. There was something about Nasha that disturbed even the headmistress: a presence that absorbed silence like a black sponge. Rooms grew still when she entered. Voices dropped. Even the maddest of children avoided her gaze.

Though Nasha was never taught magic, **she occasionally spoke in tongues**—languages unknown, layered over each other like smoke trails. Once, during a thunderstorm, she calmly told a nurse the exact moment lightning would strike the west wing. When it did, burning half the dormitories, Nasha was sitting cross-legged in the hallway, smiling faintly.

Rhoswyn began to fear her; they all did.
