### 🕯️ Birth: “The Delivery”

Nasha is the child of a **forbidden Sanctifier union**—a secret pregnancy between **[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Halric\|Sanctifier Halric]]** and **[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]]**, a low-ranking psychic acolyte known for her devotion to Mind-Chain experimentation. Nasha was born in secret, alone, in a storage room beneath [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]]. Her mother, [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]], had defied [[The Order\|The Order]] to terminate the pregnancy, fearing shame or reprisal if discovered. In silence and fear, Virelle wrapped the newborn in a tattered red blanket and left her newborn daughter on the cold stone threshold of [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]], still damp with afterbirth and secrecy. No note.  

It was Headmistress [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]] who found her first—woken by a silent scream in her sleep. She followed the sound not with her ears but with her mind, and when she opened the Asylum’s front door, she did not flinch at the infant left to the frost. She simply bent down, examined the girl’s eyes—silver-gray and wide—and whispered, “You do not belong here.”

### **Childhood in the Whispering Asylum**

Nasha wasn’t raised. She was hidden.

When [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]] first saw the child—wrapped in bloodied linens and left on the Asylum’s steps—she knew exactly who she was. The scandal could’ve unraveled everything. So Calvra did what she always did with problems: she buried it.  
Literally.

Nasha was locked in an unused storage room in [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]]. A place with no bed, no toys, and no light. Just broken furniture, old linens, rusted tools—and rats. So many rats. She survived on them. At first out of desperation. Later, with eerie calm.

No one spoke to her. No one taught her. Yet Nasha learned. She listened through the walls. She mimicked the whispers. She began speaking words she had no way of knowing—old, forgotten tongues that tangled together like smoke in her mouth. She etched symbols into the wood with her fingernails. They pulsed when no one was looking.

And she was never let out.

The door stayed locked. The light never came. And so she adapted.

She stopped standing. Crawled instead, silently. Her body thinned, her nails grew sharp, her skin turned sallow in the dark. She no longer spoke in words—only in murmurs, mutters, and the layered, curling tongues that slithered from her like breath from a crypt.

She had become feral.  
Not wild like an animal, but something far worse—forgotten, unfinished, unobserved. A thought left alone too long. A prayer buried without a god to hear it.
