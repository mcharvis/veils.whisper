### The Flame that Lied

Seren was once a symbol of radiant hope—a paladin born of forgotten bloodlines, raised among the fire-bearing monks of the **Pale Flame**, a sect that believed suffering tempered the soul, and that _redemption must be earned in pain and silence_. Seren believed in this doctrine completely. She walked barefoot across ruin and ash. She whispered rites to the unburied. She took the wounds of murderers into herself. She forgave what others would hang.

Until **Basville**.

### The Betrayal in Basville

Seren went to **Basville**, a rotting city in [[02_World/Elethon\|Elethon]], with suspicions of Sanctifier corruption. 

Seren saw **children burned in locked basements**, sacrifices to a stillborn god kept alive by bureaucracy and blood. She found monks and priests conspiring with some members of the Noble House of Vaer-Lorne. She found **truths no oath could justify**.

And so, **she broke it**.

She shattered the altar with her bare hands. She slew a Sanctifier cardinal with a blade once kissed by ghostlight. She led six children out through the smogged catacombs and into the Evergrowing Forest.

The Pale Flame exiled her.

They branded her deathmarked, shattered her candle, and erased her name from the Ash Registry. They called her **Broken Flame**.

### Becoming the Oathbreaker

Seren did not become evil. She became **unforgiven**.

She wanders now, wings blackened and smoldering like coal under ash. Her eyes no longer burn gold—they flicker with gray, exhausted light. She wears no holy symbol, but **her shadow moves just a breath too slow**, and sometimes, when she draws her blade, the wind grows silent.

She does not preach. She **intervenes**.

When tyrants kneel to false gods, she is the hand that pulls the curtain down.

When twisted paladins burn villages in the name of order, she is the sword that says _“No more.”_

### The Pale Flame's Shame

The Pale Flame won’t speak of Seren.

But some say her **candle still burns**, hidden in their inner sanctum—smokeless and still, refusing to go out.

Because though she broke her oath, **she kept its heart**.

### The Powers that Follow

As an Oathbreaker, Seren commands **frightful authority**. Not through cruelty, but through **presence**—her very existence **shames zealots and rattles the self-righteous**. Her spells no longer shimmer with divine light. They glow like embers caught in bone.

- Her **[[Spells/Aura of Hate\|Aura of Hate]]** only empowers those around her who fight for the wronged. It corrupts those who once used righteousness as a shield.

- Her **[[Spells/Control Undead\|Control Undead]]** (Animate Undead) is not cruelty—it’s penance. She commands the restless dead not to destroy, but to rest, or to speak their unfinished truth.

- Her **[[Spells/Channel Divinity\|Channel Divinity]]** is not a divine gift—it is **a rejection**, a raw scream that forces others to feel the weight of their actions.

### Who is Seren Now?

She is no longer a knight.

She is no longer holy.

But she is **good**—in the old way. In the _gritty, heavy, painful_ way. She defends without allegiance. She fights without banners. She mourns for those who still kneel to liars.
