_Absolute Night_  
_Demigoddess, one of the Abandoned Sisters of Nerull_

---

### **Overview**

Nyx embodies **absolute night**—not gentle starlight or quiet reflection, but the crushing black where no boundaries exist. In her dominion, laws dissolve, bonds unravel, and control shatters. She is the embodiment of fear, chaos, and freedom twisted into cruelty.

Though Chaotic Evil, Nyx opposes Nerull with ferocity. Not out of compassion, but out of defiance. She rejects his dominion because it reeks of order and control, and she despises being abandoned by him as though she were expendable. For Nyx, _no one_ holds dominion over her night.

---

### **Appearance**

Nyx’s form is a silhouette so dark it seems to devour light. Only faint streaks of violet energy outline her movements, like cracks in reality itself. Her eyes glow with shifting pinpricks of starlight, cold and watchful. Her garments writhe as though alive, made of shadowstuff that lashes out when threatened. Around her, darkness isn’t absence—it’s a consuming presence that presses against the lungs and claws at sanity.

### **Domain & Influence**

- **Titles:** The Shadow-Tyrant, The Abyss Unbound, Mistress of Defiance
    
- **Portfolio:** Darkness, chaos, rebellion, destruction of control, the primal void
	
- **Followers:** Assassins, anarchists, betrayers, outcasts who crave power through freedom
    

Nyx rules over the **Umbrals**, shadow-things born of lawlessness. They are inconsistent and treacherous, sometimes guiding mortals into hidden truths, sometimes dragging them screaming into the dark.

---

### **Personality**

Nyx is cruel, cunning, and violently independent. She relishes breaking chains, whether literal or metaphorical, and views trust as weakness. While not sadistic for its own sake, she delights in dismantling structures—kingships, cults, alliances—and watching chaos bloom.

Her hatred of Nerull is personal. She despises his order, his dominion, and his belief that mortals must kneel to him in death. Her rebellion is not altruism; she would gladly let mortals suffer so long as Nerull’s grip falters.

### **Myth & Role in the Veil**

When Nerull sacrificed his sisters, Nyx was the only one who did not weep or accept her fate. She shattered her chains in rage, melting into the void. Legends claim she hides in folds of night untouched even by the gods, plotting her brother’s downfall.

Nyx represents the **chaos of freedom unbound**. She may side with mortals against Nerull, but her aid always comes with dangerous consequences. To walk with Nyx is to invite betrayal as much as liberation.
