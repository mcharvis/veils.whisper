_Demigoddess of The Stillness of Death_  
_One of the Abandoned Sisters of Nerull_

![Hecate.png](/img/user/06_NPCs/Hecate.png)


### **Overview**

Hecate is one of the forsaken sisters cast aside during Nerull’s rise. While her siblings embody vengeance or hope within the night, Hecate is the embodiment of death’s stillness—the immovable silence that falls when breath ceases, the suffocating quiet of a battlefield after slaughter, the weight of eternity pressing down upon a grave.

She is not cruel, nor kind. She is inevitability itself, expressed not through decay or malice, but through the **absence of motion, sound, and time**. Her dominion lies not in the act of killing, but in the profound stillness that makes death undeniable.

### **Appearance**

Hecate manifests as a towering figure shrouded in black-grey robes that flow like smoke yet fall heavy as stone. Her skin is pale as marble, her lips colorless, her eyes twin voids where no light reflects. Around her, silence hangs unnaturally—footsteps dull, whispers falter, even heartbeats feel faint. Her presence is less seen and more _felt_—a pressure that bends the air and stills the world.

### **Domain & Influence**

- **Titles:** The Silent Judge, The Unmoving Veil, The Stillborn Hour
    
- **Portfolio:** Silence, inevitability, stillness, time’s cessation, the threshold between life and death
    
- **Followers:** Gravekeepers, executioners, stoics, oracles, those who accept death with dignity
    

Hecate does not send minions in abundance. Instead, she commands the **Nullborn**, quiet shades that appear as humanoid silhouettes with blurred features. They enforce silence, disrupt magic, and carry out her judgment without voice or expression.

---

### **Personality**

Hecate is unflinchingly neutral—stoic, detached, and unyielding. She does not revel in death, nor does she mourn it. To her, death is not tragedy or release; it is balance. Her silence is not merciful or cruel, but **absolute**. Her followers describe her as a figure who does not speak unless it is to end argument, a still presence that leaves mortals both uneasy and strangely at peace.

Unlike her sister Tisiphone, who feels deeply, Hecate does not bear empathy. Yet her constancy makes her a source of grim comfort—she is incorruptible, impartial, and immovable.

### **Myth & Role in the Veil**

When Nerull sacrificed his sisters, Hecate did not resist. She stepped into stillness willingly, knowing that even gods must one day bow to silence. Some legends claim that Nerull fears her still—that his own end will come in the moment her stillness eclipses even his dominion of death.

Hecate is the reminder that there is no escaping the pause between heartbeats, the silence after last words. She is not enemy or ally by nature—only those who disturb her balance draw her judgment.

### **Powers & Gifts**

- **Aura of Stillness:** All sound within her presence ceases. Speech, spells with verbal components, and even screams are stifled.
    
- **Temporal Quiet:** Time seems to slow or stop in her vicinity, though this is more sensation than true suspension.
    
- **Null Magic:** She can unravel spells, cutting them apart with silence rather than counterspell.
    
- **The Nullborn:** Her shades manifest in places of death, enforcing silence and stillness until her will is complete.
