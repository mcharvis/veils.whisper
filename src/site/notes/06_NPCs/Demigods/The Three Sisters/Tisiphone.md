_Demigoddess of The Reflective Night_  

_One of the Abandoned Sisters of Nerull_

![Tisiphone.png](/img/user/06_NPCs/Tisiphone.png)


### **Overview**

Tisiphone is one of the three sisters Nerull abandoned in his ascent to godhood. Unlike her kin Nyx and Hecate, whose domains lean into vengeance and fate, Tisiphone embodies the gentler, more reflective aspects of the night. She is the quiet hush, the soothing rhythm of  beneath starlight across still waters, and the tender silence that allows weary souls to rest.

Her presence is not the devouring darkness Nerull commands, but the healing dark—where contemplation and solace live. For those who have lost everything, she offers the soft reminder that even night carries stars.

### **Appearance**

Tisiphone appears as an ethereal figure, draped in veils of shimmering night-silk that seem woven from starlight itself. Her hair flows like strands of silver moonlight, her eyes vast and filled with galaxies. Unlike the grim countenance of her brother, she radiates warmth and serenity, though sorrow is etched into every gesture—an eternal reminder of her abandonment.

### **Domain & Influence**

- **Titles:** The Reflective Night, Star-Mother, Keeper of Quiet Hope
    
- **Portfolio:** Moonlight, stars, reflection, empathy, contemplation, peace in sorrow
    
- **Symbol:** A crescent moon cradling a single star

Tisiphone commands the **Luminae**, star-born spirits who appear as radiant motes of silver fire. These beings drift through Elarith at night, guiding the lost, easing pain, and whispering truths meant to heal rather than wound.

---

### **Personality**

Tisiphone is kind, deeply empathetic, and quietly resolute. She listens more than she speaks, and when she does, her words are deliberate, often poetic, and charged with profound meaning. Unlike many divine beings, she does not demand worship, but gently accepts it as an act of love freely given. Her empathy is so vast that she often takes on the sorrows of mortals herself, weakening her but binding her ever closer to them.

### **Myth & Role in the Veil**

Once, Tisiphone stood beside Nerull as he clawed his way toward godhood. When he sacrificed her and her sisters for power, she did not curse him. Instead, she wept quietly, the stars dimming with her grief. Yet in her abandonment, she found purpose: to be the counterpoint to her brother’s cruelty, to show that night does not always devour—it can also shelter and renew.

Tisiphone represents the possibility of hope even in Nerull’s shadow. She is a potential ally to mortals who dare walk the dark paths of the world, though her aid is never without cost: those who accept her gifts often carry fragments of her sorrow within themselves.

### **Powers & Gifts**

- **Mirror of Night:** Tisiphone shows mortals visions of themselves reflected in the starlight—sometimes comforting, sometimes brutally honest.
    
- **Empathic Bond:** She feels the pain of those she aids, binding herself to their struggles.
