_Former Sanctifier. Mother betrayed. Survivor twice over._

## Identity

- **True Name:** [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]]
    
- **Hidden Identity:** Malis Vain, _The Scarlet Raven_
    
- **Class/Theme:** Sanctifier → Apostate → Dark Prophetess
    
- **Alignment Shift:** Lawful Neutral → Lawful Evil
    
- **Signature Imagery:** Black-plumed cloak streaked crimson, a silver raven-skull clasp, ritual dagger with a feather-wrapped hilt, blood-and-wax-scented parchments.
    

### **Past**

**Low-Ranking Acolyte**  
Samantha Virelle’s place in the Sanctifiers was never meant to rise above obedience. She was a quiet cog in the machine, a psychic acolyte devoted to the _Mind-Chains_—the Order’s brutal process of tearing out emotion and memory to “heal” the mind. To her, it was artistry: clean, precise, purposeful cruelty.

**The Forbidden Bond**  
In Ya’a Thalor’s stone halls, she fell into a secret affair with **[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Halric\|Sanctifier Halric]]**, the feared overseer. When she became pregnant, both saw only scandal. She was told to terminate the pregnancy but should couldn't bring herself to do it. She sought to end the pregnancy, but fear—and perhaps a flicker of hope—stayed her hand. At seven months, she delivered a frail, premature daughter: **[[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]]**.

Shame kept her from discussing the child publicly. She wrapped the infant in a red blanket and left her on the threshold of **The Whispering Asylum**, abandoning her to the same kind of “care” she herself administered to strangers.

**Halric’s Cruelty**  
When Halric discovered the truth, his punishment was absolute. She was stripped of rank, shackled in the lower chambers, and used as a subject for torment—years of binding, beatings, and experiments at his command. She became a tool, not a peer.

### **The Breaking Point**

**The Zombie Ambush**  
During the Ahrown undead incursion into Ya’a Thalor, Virelle was still strapped to an iron table receiving her regular punishment. The screams above grew closer. The door burst open—not with rescue, but with an **ogre zombie** that smashed her into the wood until her ribs cracked and teeth shattered.

It would have killed her had **[[05_Player Characters/Vespertina\|Vespertina]]** not arrived mid-assault. Vespertina cut the beast down and freed her.

But to Virelle, the moment wasn’t salvation—it was interruption. She had been ready for the end. Instead, she was dragged back into a life she didn’t want.

---

### **Present Day**

**The Shattered Mother**  
Now Virelle has learned the truth: **the party killed [[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]]**. Whether directly by their hands or as the result of their actions, her daughter—already a victim of Virelle’s abandonment—is gone.

**The Scarlet Raven Rises**  
Her grief fuses with hatred. The Sanctifiers abandoned her. Her daughter is dead. The _Mind-Chain_ no longer feels like purpose—it feels like a weapon she should turn outward. She fashions a new identity: **Malis Fiani, The Scarlet Raven**. The name is an anagram of her birth, a private reminder that she is the same woman, but stripped of loyalty, mercy, and restraint.

She begins gathering outcasts, deserters, and broken Sanctifiers into a splinter faction. Their calling card: a single crimson-dyed raven feather left on the eyes of the dead.

---

### **Future Arc**

**Phase 1 — The First Feather**  
Rumors spread of targeted killings—victims with no connection except the crimson feather over their eyes. The party will eventually recognize the pattern.

**Phase 2 — The Murder’s Flight**  
Her assassins—called _The Murder_—start striking Sanctifiers and allies of the party alike. Survivors speak of a woman with black-plumed shoulders and a voice like silk over steel.

**Phase 3 — The Veil’s Curse**  
She acquires an object of significance (Mosaic Die, cursed relic, or Sanctifier secret)  

**Phase 4 — The Blood Moon Reckoning**  
Her final act is a ritual sacrifice under a blood moon, intended to “return Nasha’s soul” by feeding it with the lives of those who wronged her. She intends to include the party among them.

---

### **Hooks for Introduction**

- **Indirect Encounter:** NPCs whisper her name only as “The Scarlet Raven” and avoid speaking it twice.
    
- **Emotional Hook:** NPCs who knew Nasha may tell the party fragments of her life, creating guilt before they even meet Virelle.
    
- **Slow Reveal:** She interacts with the party under an alias long before revealing herself—perhaps even offering them aid—then turns once they realize who she is.

**Murder’s Eclipse (Recharge 5–6).**  
As an action, Malis summons a whirling column of spectral ravens in a 40-ft radius for 1 minute. The area becomes heavily obscured. Enemies inside take 14 (4d6) slashing damage at the start of their turn and must succeed on a DC 20 Constitution save or be blinded until the end of their next turn.

**Mind Chains (Recharge 6).**  
Malis targets up to 3 creatures she can see within 60 ft. Each must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute as illusory psychic chains bind their limbs. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns, ending the effect on a success.
