_Former Sanctifier. Mother betrayed. Survivor twice over._

## Identity

- **True Name:** [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]]
    
- **Class/Theme:** Sanctifier → Apostate → Dark Prophetess
    
- **Alignment Shift:** Lawful Neutral → Lawful Evil

### **Past**

**Low-Ranking Acolyte**  
Samantha Virelle’s place in the Sanctifiers was never meant to rise above obedience. She was a quiet cog in the machine, a psychic acolyte devoted to the _Mind-Chains_—the Order’s brutal process of tearing out emotion and memory to “heal” the mind. To her, it was artistry: clean, precise, purposeful cruelty.

**The Forbidden Bond**  
In Ya’a Thalor’s stone halls, she fell into a secret affair with **[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Halric\|Sanctifier Halric]]**, the feared overseer. When she became pregnant, both saw only scandal. She was told to terminate the pregnancy but should couldn't bring herself to do it. She sought to end the pregnancy, but fear—and perhaps a flicker of hope—stayed her hand. At seven months, she delivered a frail, premature daughter: **[[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]]**.

Shame kept her from discussing the child publicly. She wrapped the infant in a red blanket and left her on the threshold of **The Whispering Asylum**, abandoning her to the same kind of “care” she herself administered to strangers.

**Halric’s Cruelty**  
When Halric discovered the truth, his punishment was absolute. She was stripped of rank, shackled in the lower chambers, and used as a subject for torment—years of binding, beatings, and experiments at his command. She became a tool, not a peer.

### **The Breaking Point**

**The Zombie Ambush**  
During the Ahrown undead incursion into [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]], Virelle was still strapped to an iron table receiving her regular punishment. The screams above grew closer. The door burst open—not with rescue, but with an **ogre zombie** that smashed her into the wood until her ribs cracked and teeth shattered.

It would have killed her had **[[05_Player Characters/Vespertina\|Vespertina]]** not arrived mid-assault. Vespertina cut the beast down and freed her.

But to Virelle, the moment wasn’t salvation—it was interruption. She had been ready for the end. Instead, she was dragged back into a life she didn’t want.

### **Present Day**

**The Shattered Mother**  
Now Virelle has learned the truth: **the party killed [[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]]**. Whether directly by their hands or as the result of their actions, her daughter—already a victim of Virelle’s abandonment—is gone.

**The Scarlet Raven Rises**  
Her grief fuses with hatred. The Sanctifiers abandoned her. Her daughter is dead. The _Mind-Chain_ no longer feels like purpose—it feels like a weapon she should turn outward. She fashions a new identity: **Malis Fiani, The Scarlet Raven**. The name is an anagram of her name and title, a private reminder that she is the same woman, but stripped of loyalty, mercy, and restraint.
