### Background

Velura Elaris grew up in **Vis’Avae**, a land full of color and a strange fae influence. Life there was touched by whimsy: lanterns that floated without flame, rivers that shimmered with hidden lights, and markets where illusion and reality blurred. Velura seemed born of that place — a human girl with a natural gift for sorcery, instinctively weaving spells like song or breath.

She was known for her warmth and gentleness. Instead of chasing glory or ambition, Velura used her magic to mend, to protect, and to brighten lives. Children followed her when she sang little cantrips that set [[luminae\|luminae]] dancing, and travelers remembered her for conjuring lights to guide them safely home.

Her quiet path changed when she became connected to **[[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]]**, one of the Abandoned Sisters. Where others might have been consumed or corrupted by that power, Velura carried it with grace, never losing her compassion. 

When **[[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]] turned ten**, Velura set out to take her north to **[[02_World/Ahrown, The Kingdom of Elves/Talazan Academy\|Talazan Academy]]**, hoping her daughter’s gifts could be nurtured in safety and away from Sanctifier control. They never reached their destination. On the road, Velura was seized. Miren escaped through means still unclear — some say she wandered into the forest and found her way to the Whispering Asylum — but mother and daughter were never reunited. Velura has remained a prisoner of **[[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]]** ever since, her spirit unbroken but her heart fixed on the child she lost. Although she is a relatively low-level sorceress, her alignment to Tisiphone made her a target. To [[06_NPCs/Councilor Varn Drest\|Councilor Varn Drest]] and [[06_NPCs/Commander Velexia\|Commander Velexia]], Velura was not sorceress — she was weapon that could bring down the Sanctifiers.

A spy promised to smuggle a note to a wandering trader named [[06_NPCs/Farrún, The Wayfinder\|Farrún, The Wayfinder]] to be given to Miren. However, he was killed by [[06_NPCs/Pets/Otis\|Otis]], Commander Velexia's direwolf.

### Rescue

Her captivity ended during the chaos at Jade Stronghold. The adventurers staged a diversion — an explosion that rocked the fortress just as the Sanctifiers descended on it. In the confusion, Velura was freed and spirited away. When the dust cleared, her absence was blamed on the Sanctifiers. To [[06_NPCs/Commander Velexia\|Commander Velexia]] and [[06_NPCs/Councilor Varn Drest\|Councilor Varn Drest]], it appeared she was carried off by the attackers, and the adventurers weren't suspected

Velura, at last free, owes her life to the party — but the world believes she is still lost, hidden in the clutches of the Sanctifiers.

### Personality

- **Compassionate:** Even in captivity, she shows kindness to guards, servants, and strangers.
- **Resilient:** Her spirit has not dulled despite years of confinement. 
- **Maternal:** Every thought returns to Miren; she carries the grief of losing her daily. 
- **Quietly Defiant:** She refuses to let the Sanctifiers use her power, no matter what they promise.
