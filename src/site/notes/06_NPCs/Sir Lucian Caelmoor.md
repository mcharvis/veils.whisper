_Knight of the Forgotten Tomb_

**Sir Lucian Caelmoor** is one of **four knights** who remain within the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Temple of the Forgotten Hero\|Temple of the Forgotten Hero]], stationed in deliberate formation sworn to protect a memory. Their armor is worn, their blades nicked with age—but their discipline remains absolute.

They do not speak.  
They do not move unless the tomb is violated.  
And when they do, it is with **terrifying unity.**

Lucian was once the most outspoken of the [[04_Organizations/Ebony Wake\|Ebony Wake]], a knightly order known for its fierce loyalty to ideals over kings. He followed the [[06_NPCs/Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame\|Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame]] into exile and stood by them during the final betrayal. When the Hero fell, Lucian did not seek vengeance. He and three others chose a different oath—**one of remembrance through service**, not bloodshed. He bound himself to the tomb willingly, not through necromancy or divine coercion, but through sheer conviction.

Established alliance with [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar Relkth\|Kovinar Relkth]] at the Battle of The Forgotten Temple through *Divine Salvation*.
