- **Race**: Elf (appears 10–12 years old)
    
- **Cell**: A small stone chamber on the **4th floor of Jade Stronghold**, barred and dim, with only a cot and a single candle stub.
    
- **Condition**: Frail, underfed, barefoot. His silence is not magical—it’s trauma. He hasn’t spoken a word in years.

### **Backstory**

Ellis was taken from the outskirts of Ahrown after his parents were executed for treason against the elven throne. No one in Jade Stronghold seems entirely sure _why_ he is kept unalive. Some guards mutter that he’s a bargaining chip against Ahrown’s nobility, others that he’s simply a forgotten captive.

What is certain is that Ellis is valuable enough to imprison, but not enough to treat with dignity. The Stronghold keeps him under lock and key, but no official record explains why. He is just “the boy in the cell.”

### **Role in the Story**

- **A Child Among Wolves**: His imprisonment reveals the Stronghold’s willingness to exploit anyone—child or not—for leverage.
    
- **The Silent Witness**: Ellis has seen and heard far more than he lets on. Guards talk freely around him, thinking he’s too broken to matter.
    
- **Uncertain Importance**: The party will have to decide if freeing him is mercy, a distraction, or a political disaster if the Stronghold (or Ahrown) comes hunting.

### **How He Comes Across**

- He sits cross-legged on the floor, staring at the cracks in the stone.
    
- If given food, he eats slowly, cautiously, as if waiting for it to be taken away.
    
- He flinches from raised voices but does not cry. His silence is absolute—more chilling than words.
