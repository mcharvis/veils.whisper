**Role:** Council member of the Oasis Civil Assembly  
**Allegiance:** Oasis first, though sympathetic to the Pale Flame’s ideals of restraint and accountability  
**Alignment (broad strokes):** Lawful Neutral, leaning toward Good

### Background

Liora was born into a minor merchant family in Oasis. Her father dealt in lumber from the Evergrowing Forest, while her mother worked as a healer. Unlike the entrenched noble houses who treat the city as their inheritance, Liora rose from ordinary roots. She grew up watching her neighbors pay the price for corruption and careless deals, and she learned quickly that politics was less about speeches and more about survival.

Her early reputation was earned in disputes with the lumber guilds, where she proved herself quick-witted, unafraid of confrontation, and deeply protective of common citizens. She won her Assembly seat by promising to hold both noble houses and councilors accountable — something few in Oasis actually dared to say aloud.

### Personality

Liora is blunt, observant, and not easily manipulated. She speaks in clear, short sentences, preferring precision to theatrics. While Drest twists words like knives, Liora uses hers like nails — she hammers down her points until no one in the room can ignore them.

Though not warm, she is trusted by the people for her consistency. She has a reputation for walking the poorer districts without guards, listening directly to complaints, and filing them into Assembly disputes even when it wins her no friends.

### Strengths

- **Unyielding:** Once she has evidence, she will not let go until the truth is forced into the open.
- **Support Base:** She has strong connections with guilds, healers, and traders — people often overlooked by Oasis nobles.
- **Survivor’s Instinct:** Liora has learned to survive in a council where everyone else is richer, better connected, or more corrupt.

### Weaknesses

- **Too Honest:** In politics, honesty is dangerous. Her bluntness makes her enemies quickly.
- **Few Allies:** Her opposition to Drest has left her isolated in the Assembly. She is more respected than loved.
- **Resentment:** She distrusts the nobility of Oasis on principle, and sometimes dismisses good-faith offers as traps.

### Connection to Jade Stronghold

While Liora rarely visits the Stronghold herself, she has opposed its use as a personal tool for Drest’s schemes. She has attempted tpublicly criticize the imprisonment of [[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|Velura Elaris]] there, seeing it as a political hostage situation rather than a matter of justice. Drest paints her as naïve, soft, or secretly aligned with Oasis’s enemies.

In truth, Liora is sharp enough to know the Stronghold is a powder keg. If it falls or fractures, Oasis politics will collapse with it — and she intends to survive the fallout, with her reputation intact.

### Political Alliance

Liora represents a potential ally — but one who will demand proof before she offers trust. She does not give loyalty easily, especially to outsiders. What she values most is **evidence and leverage**: if the party brings her solid proof of Drest’s corruption or helps expose one of his schemes, she will stand behind them in the Assembly.
