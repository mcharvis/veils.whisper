A non-combatant manipulator and dangerous political schemer—ideal for interrogation, social challenges, or low-level magical interference.
Previously controlled the [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]] until [[Battle - The Siege of Jade Stronghold\|Battle - The Siege of Jade Stronghold]]. Associated with [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Oasis\|Oasis]]. 

![Councilor Varn Drest - 2.png](/img/user/Councilor%20Varn%20Drest%20-%202.png)
- Bureaucrat and realist.
- Appears to be trying to stop the Sanctifiers politically—but secretly using Oasis funds to subsidize the Sanctifiers.
- Was hiding Velura’s existence to use her as a weapon. Unclear target.
- Charismatic, cunning, and corrupt.
- Drest positions himself as “for the people,” offering small reforms and voicing frustrations—but he pockets coin from shadow deals, and makes quiet pacts to keep his power.
- He resents the Vaer-Lorne family but plays loyal to keep access to Thornhold’s courts and revenue. 
- In truth, he seeks to **outlast** them all—possibly by aligning with darker forces. 

Varn Drest was born into a logging family in Oasis. His parents owned logging businesses along the forest, and from a young age he learned that coin and information mattered more than swords. When his brothers took over the family business, Drest went into politics. He began as a clerk for the Civil Assembly, memorizing the debts and weaknesses of every noble who came through.

He built his career not on bravery but on leverage. He funded small militias, paid bribes, and made sure every risk he took was covered by someone else’s blood or money. Drest survived scandals that ended other men by being the one who held their secrets. He knew when to stand in front of the Assembly and when to disappear into the back halls.

Over time, his influence grew. Drest positioned himself as the “practical” choice in Oasis politics—less idealistic than reformers, less brutal than hardliners, always willing to compromise if it meant he stayed relevant. He attached himself to projects that looked good but avoided true danger, letting others fight while he claimed the credit.

When Jade Stronghold was established, Drest secured his seat as the councilor tied to its oversight. His speeches made him sound like a patriot, but [[06_NPCs/Commander Velexia\|Commander Velexia]] began to become suspicious of him.

Drest is not brave, but he is clever. He thrives in the shadows, makes sure others carry the risk, and survives when stronger men fall.

Currently, he escaped in the the tunnle beneath [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]] during [[Battle - The Siege of Jade Stronghold\|Battle - The Siege of Jade Stronghold]]
