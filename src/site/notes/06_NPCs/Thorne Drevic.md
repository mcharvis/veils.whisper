**Role:** Former bandit captain, now aligned with Kovinar

### Background

Thorne Drevic grew up on the edges of Oasis, scraping by with theft, smuggling, and highway raids. Life offered him little beyond hunger and hard choices, so he gathered a band of cutthroats who learned to follow his lead. He was no visionary — just a man who kept his crew alive and coin in their pockets.

When Jade Stronghold needed extra hands, Thorne and his band were brought in as cheap mercenaries to guard the lower halls. They weren’t trusted, only tolerated. 

For the first time, he saw the limits of a life in the Stronghold. Kovinar Relkth offered him a chance at something more — not redemption exactly, but purpose. Thorne now aligns with [[06_NPCs/Gods/Bahamut\|Bahamut]] through [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]]. When the Stronghold fell into chaos, most of his men were cut down. Thorne is reportedly close to death...
