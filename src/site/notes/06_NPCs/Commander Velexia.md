Velexia was born in the slums of Oasis. Her father was a glassworker who ruined his hands on the furnace, and her family lived in poverty. As a teenager, she and her family were forced into labor during one of the forest border conflicts. When raiders attacked the camp, her parents were killed. Velexia fought with whatever she could find and killed her first man that night while protecting her younger siblings.

She was noticed by soldiers and taken in as a camp guard. From there she became a squire, then a foot soldier. She trained harder than anyone else, studied tactics at night, and pushed herself into every dangerous mission she could. Her rise wasnâ€™t easyâ€”she was mocked for her background and challenged often. She fought duels in training yards and skirmishes on the field, and she won enough of them to build her reputation.

Her turning point came at the Battle of the Crooked Bridge. When her captainâ€™s plan faltered, Velexia acted on her own. She led a dozen soldiers through waist-deep water, flanked the raiders, and hit them at exactly the right moment. It turned the fight and saved the crossing. She was punished for disobedience but promoted soon after.

From there her career was built on grit and visible results. She won battles by making hard calls and earned loyalty by leading from the front. The men trusted her because she never sent them anywhere she wouldnâ€™t go herself.

When Oasis established Jade Stronghold as its forward fortress, Velexia was chosen to command. She wasnâ€™t the most politically connected, but she was the one the soldiers believed in. Her body carries scars from nearly every campaign sheâ€™s fought in, and her authority comes from survival, sacrifice, and victories no one else thought possible.
