**Rank:** High Sanctifier, Veilshifter (once trusted, now disgraced)  
**Status:** Imprisoned in Jade Stronghold

### Background

Dronir Maelth used to be a respected Sanctifier officer. As a **Veilshifter**, he had the ability to slip through barriers, bend distance, and move unseen. On the battlefield, that made him valuable for scouting, ambushes, and escapes.

His downfall came during the zombie ambush at **[[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]]**. When the undead overran his unit, Maelth didn’t stand and fight. He vanished using his Veilshifting, leaving his soldiers to die while he saved himself. Survivors called him a coward. Maelth believes he saw something in those undead — something darker — that made him panic.

Afterward, the Sanctifiers branded him a deserter. Although he escaped, he was captured by the **[[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Jade Stronghold\|Jade Stronghold]]**, where he sat imprisoned. He’s considered too valuable to execute outright because of what he knows.

### Personality

- **Evasive:** Speaks in half-truths, never giving everything away.
    
- **Haunted:** Still relives the moment he left his soldiers behind.

### Role in the Story

Maelth represents the cracks in the Sanctifiers. He’s disgraced, but he knows secrets:

- What really happened at Ya’a Thalor.
- Details about the Sanctifiers’ experiments.

Maelth is now aligned with [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar Relkth\|Kovinar Relkth]] through [[Spells/Divine Salvation\|Divine Salvation]]. Reportedly survived [[Battles/Battle - The Siege of Jade Stronghold\|Battle - The Siege of Jade Stronghold]]
