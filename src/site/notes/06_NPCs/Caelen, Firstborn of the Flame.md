**Birth name:** Caelen, Firstborn of the Flame. 
**Ancestry:** Half-Brother of [[05_Player Characters/Inactive/Xaphan\|Xaphan]].
**Legacy:** Founder of the [[04_Organizations/Ebony Wake\|Ebony Wake]].

Before the world fractured, before the Crystallum scattered, before Nerull whispered through the bones of the dead—there were two brothers...half-brothers.

**Xaphan**, The Fallen.  
And **Caelen**, The Forgotten Hero.

They were born of fire, touched by the old gods, and entrusted with keeping balance between realms. Where Xaphan burned with bold defiance, Caelen carried burdened wisdom. Where Xaphan questioned, Caelen led. Together, they were unstoppable.

But Xaphan’s fire grew unruly. His resistance to the divine command of Nerull brought conflict. Caelen stood by him as long as he could—until the day Xaphan stepped beyond the Veil, vanishing in open defiance of Nerull.

Caelen did not follow.  
He founded the **Ebony Wake**—a knightly order devoted not to glory, but to sacrifice. Their symbol: a black tide washing away forgotten sins.

When a shadow, born of divine neglect, rose to threaten the realms in Xaphan’s absence, it was Caelen who stood against it. His final act sealed the menace away, but in doing so, bound a fragment of Caelen’s very soul. The cost was unbearable, and the world could not endure the truth—that its protector would never be whole again.

And so, **Caelen gave up everything**, even his name. He commanded that his deeds be erased, his story untold. The Ebony Wake buried him in a tomb marked only by silence and four loyal knights—[[06_NPCs/Sir Lucian Caelmoor\|Sir Lucian Caelmoor]] among them —who chose to remain and protect his rest. But even though all of the clans aligned with The Ebony Wake have forgotten Caelen, [[05_Player Characters/Renzo\|one]] still holds on to the old ways.

His name is gone.  His story is ash.  He is **The Forgotten Hero**—by design, not by failure. 

But the blood of Xaphan still runs in his veins.  
And if the Veil stirs… so might he.
