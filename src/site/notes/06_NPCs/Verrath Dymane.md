Once a scribe-turned-warmage who delighted in controlling information. He destroyed libraries not to erase knowledge, but to _hoard_ it for himself. His final act before dying was to anchor his mind to a single object: A heavy, cracked grimoire bound in stitched black leather with patches of pale parchment skin interacted with his favored writing quill, made from a manticore’s tail spine, tipped with black glass

_Medium Construct (Sentient Memory), Chaotic Evil_

### **Appearance**

- A tome bound in stitched black leather, warped as though scorched, the stitches an ugly lattice of thin red thread.
- Pages flutter without wind, ink crawling in rivulets across parchment like black centipedes.
- The manticore-spine quill floats nearby, scratching feverishly, sometimes on the pages, sometimes on any surface available — including living skin.
- When angered, letters seep from the book’s pages into the air like smoke, forming writhing shapes.

### **Nature**

Verrath is not a ghost. He is a _preserved echo_ of the cruel mage’s consciousness, bound to his own memoir — an intentional act to cheat death. His memory is imperfect, distorted by time, but his ambition and malice remain razor sharp.

He _cannot leave the book_, but the quill gives him reach. Through it, he can write messages, alter texts, or lash out with magic. He can move short distances by sliding or dragging across surfaces — or by having someone carry him.

### **Personality**

- **Arrogant Archivist** — Believes only his version of history matters.
- **Petty Manipulator** — Finds leverage in secrets, using them like currency.
- **Calculated Cruelty** — Harms through humiliation, mind-games, and erasure of identity.
- **Temporal Disconnect** — Still speaks as though he is living in his own era, regarding present-day figures as “the new crop of pawns.”
