### Backstory
Halric began as an unremarkable acolyte, a man of sharp discipline and colder ambition. Through sheer conviction, he founded The Sanctifiers, shaping them into a brotherhood that preached purity while quietly perfecting cruelty. His fascination with control drew him to [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]], whose brilliance forged the terrible art of the [[Spells/Mind Chains\|Mind Chains]]. Halric admired her loyalty and skill, and admiration soon turned into a forbidden love.

From their secret bond came a child, [[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]]. Halric demanded an abortion, unwilling to see weakness tied to his name, but Virelle delivered Nasha prematurely. Nasha was secretly abandoned to the Whispering Asylum.

It was Halric himself who discovered Miren in the forgotten depths of Ya’a Thalor. Believing she alone could calm [[06_NPCs/The Dreaming Mouth\|The Dreaming Mouth]], he imprisoned her and subjected her to cruel Mind Chain experiments, using her abilities for power. This gave his order a dreadful new edge.

Seeking greater reach, Halric bound himself to [[06_NPCs/Councilor Varn Drest\|Councilor Varn Drest]], who poured Oasis wealth into his hands. With that gold, [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Sanctum of Withered Light\|The Sanctum of Withered Light]] began developing an elite corps of Sanctifiers trained in secret by [[04_Organizations/The Pale Flame\|The Pale Flame]]. But whispers of his corruption spread. Certain that an execution party would come for him, Halric forced his brethren into a ritual suicide pact. While most of them perished, he faked his own death and vanished into exile, leaving Ya’a Thalor abandoned.

The ruin did not remain empty. Soon after, an elven zombie horde from the [[02_World/Ahrown, The Kingdom of Elves/Capital of Ahrown\|Capital of Ahrown]] swept through the halls, defiling what remained of his legacy.

Halric secretly lead the [[Battles/Battle - The Siege of Jade Stronghold\|The Siege of Jade Stronghold]], in hopes to capture [[06_NPCs/Miren Elaris\|Miren Elaris]]'s mother, [[06_NPCs/Velura Elaris\|Velura Elaris]]. But she was never there; the effort failed, and Councilor Varn Drest slipped away into hiding. Broken and desperate, Halric returned to Mithril Hills, where he made his final gamble for power: the summoning of [[06_NPCs/Malphas\|Malphas]], the Black Crow.

It was there that his ambition ended. [[05_Player Characters/Kovinar\|Kovinar]]’s blade struck him down, severing both the man and the monster he had become.
