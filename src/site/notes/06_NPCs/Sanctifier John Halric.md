## Status

Dead.
Previously thought to be entombed — Said to have crawled in his crypt at [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/Ya'a Thalor\|Ya'a Thalor]] but intel revealed he faked his death. 

## Known History

In his desperation to preserve what was being erased, he summoned Malphas, The Duke of Hell...unknowlingly with the help of [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Samantha Virelle\|Sanctifier Samantha Virelle]]

## Description

- Tall, gaunt man in rusted armor
    
- Cloaked in chains that drag behind him—each etched with names long scratched out

## Alignment

Lawful... _something_. No longer good, not quite evil. Bound by oaths no one else remembers.

## Personality

Measured. Calculating. Always listening.  
He speaks in the past tense, even when referring to the present. He loathes prophecy and pities oracles.  

He would refer to himself as “what remains of Halric.”
