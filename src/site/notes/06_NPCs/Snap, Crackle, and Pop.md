- **Snap** (LE, Head Cook): Gruff, one-eyed, and wears a bloodstained apron like armor. Thinks he’s in charge. Has a surprisingly refined palate. Will only respect people who cook. 
- **Crackle** (CE, Knife Goblin): Jumpy, mutters in Common and Goblin, has three visible knives and many invisible ones. Communicates in high-pitched complaints and weird noises. Suspiciously informed about what’s happening on **Floor 6**. 
- **Pop** (CN, Emotional Support): Plump, friendly, and too soft-hearted for goblin society. Obsessed with making the perfect sweet bun. Might cry if yelled at.
