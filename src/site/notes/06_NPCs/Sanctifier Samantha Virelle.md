<p align="left">فيريل</p>
Samantha Virelle was never meant for command. A low-ranking psychic acolyte in the Sanctifiers, she earned notice not for leadership but for her unwavering commitment to _Mind Chain_ experimentation—the sect’s cruel ritual of extracting memory and emotion to “purify” the mind. She took pride in the work, seeing beauty in the cold precision.

Her loyalty to the cause was fractured in secret. In the shadow of Ya’a Thalor’s stone corridors, she fell into a forbidden relationship with [[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Halric\|Sanctifier Halric]], the Sanctifiers’ most feared overseer. When she bore his child, [[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]]—a girl delivered seven months premature—the scandal was too dangerous for either to acknowledge. She had defied [[The Order\|The Order]] to terminate the pregnancy, fearing shame or reprisal if discovered. In silence and fear, Virelle wrapped the newborn in a tattered red blanket and left her newborn daughter on the cold stone threshold of [[02_World/01_The Evergrowing Forest/The Whispering Asylum\|The Whispering Asylum]], still damp with afterbirth and secrecy. No note. 

[[06_NPCs/Sanctifier Halric\|Sanctifier Halric]]’s response was merciless. For years, at his command, she was kept not as a colleague but as a prisoner—regularly strapped to a table, subjected to physical torment. 

The night of the **zombie ambush**, she was still bound, wrists raw against iron loops in the sanctum’s lower chamber. As Sanctifiers died screaming in the corridors above, an **ogre zombie** tore through the room. It did not kill her cleanly. It beat her into the table, each blow cracking ribs and rattling loose teeth, until her world blurred into blood and stone.

She might have died there, unremarked and unmourned—if not for [[05_Player Characters/Vespertina\|05_Player Characters/Vespertina]], who arrived mid-assault. In that moment, Virelle saw her rescuer not as a savior, but as the sudden and alien interruption to a death she had long since stopped running from.

Now she is a survivor twice over—once of Halric’s cruelty, and once of the undead’s hunger. But now that she knows [[06_NPCs/Nasha\|Nasha]] was murdered, it is unclear whether she is grateful for either.

### Madga's Death
When Magda’s final scream tore through the halls, Virelle did not flinch. She stood over the ghost’s unraveling form, her hands still crackling with the raw energy she had unleashed. The act was not mercy—it was possession of power, the first time she had chosen to end rather than endure. Something inside her shifted as Magda’s essence dissolved, leaving silence where sorrow had lived. In that silence, Virelle lost her purpose... No longer the discarded acolyte, no longer the forgotten Sanctifier... the Scarlet Raven—an omen of blood, rebirth, and vengeance. The children she lost, the torment she suffered, the years strapped to the table—all of it had carved her into something sharper. What began as survival was becoming a purpose. And soon, the world would remember her not as a victim, but as a murder.
