**Role**: Potionmaster and assistant at Kelm's Tinctures  
**Personality**: Kelm: weary and brilliant; Crow: twitchy and devoted  

> Kelm: "Alchemy is patience. That’s why we’re both still alive."
> Crow: "Don’t touch the red bottle. Or the blue one. Or... actually, don’t touch anything."

**Backstory**:  
Kelm lost his wife to a corrupted brew and now searches obsessively for a cure to magical contamination. Crow was a failed apprentice elsewhere—he worships Kelm like a god.
