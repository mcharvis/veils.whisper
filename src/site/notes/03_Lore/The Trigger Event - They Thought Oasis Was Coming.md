### 🔥 The Spark: A Misinterpreted Message

Days before the Ahrown undead arrived, **a Sanctifier scout returned** with intelligence:

> REC-202
> **Oasis—Visual Confirm.**  
> Mounted unit x 24+. No sigils. Colors match **Vaer-Lorne**.  
> Blank banners = Diplomatic or Execution.  
> Intercept: rider w/ sealed scroll. **Crest: Vaer-Lorne**.  
> Contents unknown.  
> Recommend **Code SP** activation.

Then, just as paranoia began to fester, the **undead from Ahrown arrived**—fast, unannounced, overwhelming. A rogue necromancer’s army—or so they thought.

> But to the Twelve, it looked like **an elite strike force from Oasis**, hiding behind necromancy to **erase them without a trace**.

### 💀 The Decision: Suicide by Protocol

The Sanctifiers have a contingency:

> **“If dissolution is imminent, and judgment cannot be controlled, invoke Code SP. Bury the command.”**

**Code SP** is a last-ditch doctrine—**a suicide pact**. Used only when the upper echelons believe their actions will be publicly condemned or politically weaponized.

> _“Let no record remain but our stones.”_

They gathered in the crypts. They sealed the records chamber.  
And they died—some by blade, some by poison, all by choice.
