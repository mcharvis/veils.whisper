### 🩸 **Scene: The Torture Table**

The chamber is dark and wet with suffering. A female sanctifier lies strapped to a rust-crusted table, her limbs trembling and blood-soaked. One leg is twisted unnaturally, her Sanctifier robes shredded and scorched. Her breath whistles through broken teeth.  
An **ogre zombie** looms over her, its decaying fist clenched around a **filthy morningstar**, crusted with bone and hair. It lifts the weapon again.

And from the table comes a voice—not defiant, not holy—just a wrecked woman choking on blood and grief.
