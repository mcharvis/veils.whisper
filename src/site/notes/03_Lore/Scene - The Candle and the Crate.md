The spiral stone corridor beneath the church was slick with condensation, each footstep muffled by thick silence. Sanctifier Virelle clutched her belly with one hand, the other gripping the iron railing as she descended deeper into the lowest level of the church. Her robes were soaked, not with rain—but with sweat, blood, amniotic fluid, and shame.

By the time she reached the room to the right, she was trembling. A single lantern swung above her, casting stuttering shadows across the blood-slick floor.

Somewhere above her, the wards hummed. Somewhere above, her forbidden lover, [[Sancitifier Halric\|Sancitifier Halric]] was giving lectures on spiritual purity to the junior Sanctifiers, speaking as if he didn’t know. As if he hadn’t begged her to hide it...to terminate it. As if he hadn’t put the baby inside her 7 months ago.

She knelt there, alone. She bit down on her own leather sleeve to muffle the pain. Her breath hitched and child was born.

A daughter. Small. Quiet. Alive.

Virelle held the child to her chest for one long minute—just one—before wrapping her in red cloth ripped from a discarded ceremonial tablecloth. It reeked of ash and incense. She wiped the blood from the child’s eyes with trembling fingers.

> “I’m sorry, Nasha” she whispered.  
> “You were never supposed to be.”

She walked through the woods for hours before arriving at the door step.
She kissed the girl’s forehead once.  
She placed her in a crate and folded the cloth tightly.  

And then she walked away. She never looked back.

Behind her, the candle guttered once… and died just as Headmistress [[06_NPCs/Rhoswyn Calvra\|Rhoswyn Calvra]] opened the door.

**The darkness recedes like smoke sucked through a keyhole.**  
Your senses return—slowly, uncertainly. The world feels _off-kilter_, like waking from a dream that felt ... real.

There’s a metallic taste in your mouth. Some of you are sweating. One of you is crying.

The air is still thick with that **violet shimmer**, now fading like embers.

And in this silence that follows, **one of you speak first.**
