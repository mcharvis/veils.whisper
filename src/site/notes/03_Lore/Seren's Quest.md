# Seren's Mission
> _“You’ll need to speak with Tisiphone. She controls the Bellum Crystallum where the second shard is—and she doesn’t grant audience to just anyone. Your only hope in obtaining the shard is to reach Vis’Avae... and for that, you’ll need transport through a land called Vindicative Enterprises. The only place with trade routes through there is the  kingdom of Ahrown...but you'll have to convince the Mad King to provide passage through the VE.”_

**Objective:**  
Travel to the **[[Capital of Arhown\|Capital of Arhown]]**, the dark elven city, and somehow convince the **[[06_NPCs/King Aldenor\|Mad King]]** to grant safe passage through the Evergrowing Forest and through **[[Vindicative Enterprises\|Vindicative Enterprises]]** to **Vis’Avae**, where [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]] waits.

**Why It Matters:**

- The **[[Bellum Crystallum\|Bellum Crystallum]]** is guarded by [[06_NPCs/Demigods/The Three Sisters/Tisiphone\|Tisiphone]].
    
- [[02_World/Vis’Avae\|Vis’Avae]] is surrounded on either side by [[02_World/Vindicative Enterprises/VE HQ\|VE HQ]] and [[The Pedronian Empire\|The Pedronian Empire]].
    
- The **[[Capital of Arhown\|Capital of Arhown]]** has contracts with [[02_World/Vindicative Enterprises/VE HQ\|VE HQ]] for trade through to [[02_World/Vis’Avae\|Vis’Avae]] 

**Complication:**

- The [[06_NPCs/King Aldenor\|Mad King]] is unpredictable.
- The roads through **[[02_World/Vindicative Enterprises/VE HQ\|VE HQ]]** are crawling with mercenaries, living constructs, and toll-enforcing bounty squads. It is a place corrupted with cruel capitalism.
- [[Arhown\|Arhown]] is deeply xenophobic, racist towards anyone not elven...and won't trust outsiders.




- Vespertina may choose the party's own guard. Any CR 4 creature or less. Budget CR 4.
